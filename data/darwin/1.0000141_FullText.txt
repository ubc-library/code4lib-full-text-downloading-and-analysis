July 10th, 1878  My dear Fox,  I was indeed grieved to see yesterday in the Times the great loss which you have suffered.  I know well what misery this loss will cause to your affectionate disposition & to poor Mrs Fox.  Emma desires me to say how much she sympathises with you both.  It is no use whatever my writing, but I could not endurenot to do so â€“ I hope she did not suffer much.  Do not write to me unless doing something is a little relief to you.  God bless you my dear old friend.  I hope you & Mrs Fox are fairly well in bodily health.  Yours affectionately,  Charles Darwin(Envelope)  The Rev W. Darwin Fox  Sandown   Isle of Wight
