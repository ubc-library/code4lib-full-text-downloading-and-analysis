March 29th 1880 My dear Mr. Fox I had heard that your Father was out of health, but had not the least idea that he was seriously ill. Your letter grieves me much & you all have my deep sympathy. It has touched & gratified me much that your Father should have thoughts of me at such a time, but he was always full of sympathy.I saw a great deal of him in the days at Cambridge, & we went to breakfast together daily. In the course of my life, now a long one, I can truly say that I have never known a kinder or better man. â€“ I can therefore feel what a losshe will be to you all. I gather from your letter that he does not now suffer much, & this is some comfort. Believe me my dear cousin, for we are cousins though in a remote degree, that I am grateful to you for having written & I remain Yours very truly, Charles DarwinCharles W.
