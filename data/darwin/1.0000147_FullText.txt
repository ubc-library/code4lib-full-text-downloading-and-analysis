April 10, 1875    Dear Mr Darwin,  If the alterations as I have made them seem to you sufficient I think we may make them without consulting any of thosewho have already signed, for they involve no change even of words â€“ only change of order & arrangement.  The changes are however sufficient I think to avoidrisk of misconstruction.  I am afraid that I shall not be at home tomorrow after 10:30 but I will come and see you before that time or at one clock if it appears toyou desirable.  If in passing you will leave a card for me with the hour on it I will understand.  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
