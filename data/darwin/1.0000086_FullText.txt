March 31st  Down, Beckenham, Kent  My dear Dr. Sanderson.  How carefully & excellently you have made the experiments, which I fear must have cost you much trouble. They will be most useful to me, especially those on the acids & I am greatly obliged to you. There in one point which you do not mention, and which I ought to know, viz the temperature at which the experiments were tried. Drosera digests at ordinary summer temperature, & as far as casual observations serve almost equally wellduring ordinary summer weather & very hot weather. If you tried your experiments at the heat of human body or above that, it is just possible that the fatty acids would turn a better ? with the hydrochloric at lower temperatures. Would it not be worth while to try one of the fatty acids and the hydrochloric at ordinary temperatures?  Again heartily thanking you   Yours very sincerely  Ch. DarwinP.S. I do not at present think that I shall try more digestion experiments with Drosera this summer; not but while I like the work much, & your most kind offer is very tempting, but then I have other matter almost ready for publication and which, if I go on, I shall never have strength to publish.P.S. 2  If all the gobulin which I sent had not been used or thrown away, will you return me a few grains, as I shd like to try a few particles on Drosera oiling the plant with a minute drop of very weak hydrochloric acid.
