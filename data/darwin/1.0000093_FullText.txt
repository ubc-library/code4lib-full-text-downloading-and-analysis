Down, Beckenham, Kent.  June 12 1874  My dear Dr Sanderson  I have just read your article in Nature.  It is very interesting, & in my opinion cd not be better done. I look forward to the next number, in which you will give your discovery, which the more I think of, seems, to me the more important.  I hear from Frank that your illustrations were capital.  I did not answer your last note, as I had then much to do.I hope after a week or so to receive an account of your digestive experiments.   I must add that I have found another plant (Pinguicola) which catches flies & can also digest - yours very sincerely Ch DarwinP. S. I read several years ago a paper in (I think) Report of Brit Assoc J  (I think?!) by Dr. C----  B---- or  Dr Fraser on the physiological action of various salts & acids, when injected with the blood of animals. I think isomeric or isomorphous substances acted in nearly the same manner.  I remember I thought the [?]extremely curious, but I never thought that it wd concern me to use it ? for amusement   I hear in [?] [? time] [?] many acids and salts on Drosera, I shd much like to read the paper again.  Ch D.    A card with reference wd be ?amply ?
