Down,  Beckenham, Kent.  March 21 1874  My dear Dr Sanderson  I send registered by this post my M. S. on the habits of the Dionaea.  If you have patience to read it, you will perhaps find something useful for your lecture, as some parts seem to me curious.  I have not attended to style, only to intelligibility, but I have endeavoured to my utmost to be accurate.  Please sometime do returnthe M. S. as it will serve to be hereafter licked into shape â€“ You must understand that my observations were intended only as complementary to those on Drosena.  If I were in your place, I shd get my wife to read the M. S. aloud to me, but if Mrs Sanderson hears of this hint, she will say that I am an unfeeling wretch  Yours very sincerely,  Ch. DarwinP. S. My son Frank wd be delighted to attend as your assistant at your lecture, if this wd be of any use to you.
