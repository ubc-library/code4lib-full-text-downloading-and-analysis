Bassett Southampton   [Down, Beckenham, Kent – Railway Station Orpington S.E.S.]    May 13·79     My dear Sanderson,  I have been astonished by the announcement yesterday that the R. Coll of Physcns has awarded me the Baly medal & I am asked to attend to receive it after the Harveian Oration.  I mention this because I have thought that you could giveme some idea how long this oration lasts, & at what hour it takes place; for I am not  a little afraid of the exertion. Am I expected to make any speech & if so would a few words suffice? Any information would be gratefully received.  Who was Baly was he the translatorof Muller?  Pray forgive me for applying to you in my perplexity.  Yours very sincerely,  Charles Darwin
