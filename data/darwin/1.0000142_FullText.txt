Feb 12/75    Dear Mr Darwin,  Potassium phosphate is certainly decomposed in the animal body.  A double decomposition no doubt takes place between it and common salt which is always     present by virtue of which potassium chloride & sodium phosphate are produced.It appears to me likely that the reason why potassium phosphate does not act upon Drosera is this â€“ that it is present in considerable proportion in the     juices of plants & consequently probably in Drosera.  I think it would be foundthat to those salts which are present in the plant it is indifferent, even though it may be excited by others which are chemically closely allied to them.  With reference to the subject of experiments on animals, I have afterconversation with Mr Huxley prepared a memorandum intended to serve as the basis of a Petition.  It is now in his hands.  I have lately been considering very     carefully the whole question and am of course very anxious that if anything is done, it should be done in such a way as to promote rather than to hinder the     progress of science.  Believe me, Dear Mr Darwin  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
