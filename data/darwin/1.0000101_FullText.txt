Down,   Beckenham, Kent  Oct.9.74  Mr dear Dr Sanderson,  I am going to beg your opinion & information on one point if you can give it.  I am finally working up my long chapter on digestion by Drosera.  I find that fibrin, areolar tissue, the fibrous basis of bone, & gelatin all agree in being easily dissolved by the secretion, but none of them excite the leaves much, incomparably less than meat, albumen etc.  Fibrocartilage behaves in the same wayexcepting that it is never thoroughly liquefied.  Now what I want to know is whether these substances viz. – fibrin, areolar tissue, the fibrous basis of bone, gelatine, & fibrocatilage are chemically or physiologically allied, their action on animals to which they are given as food; for instance, is it known whether a dog would perish as soon when fed on fibrin as on gelatine?  I should be gratified for any scrap of informationon this lead.  You will see that I speak of the "fibrous basis of bone".  Is this a correct expression?  In almost every page of my MS I feel how much I owe to you.  Yours very sincerely   Ch Darwin  Reply – On carefully considering the fact notice viz. that the bodies fibrin, aerolar tissue, gelatin & the fibrous basis of bone differ for meat & albumin in test exciting on leaves of Drosera.that the diffc  may be dependent on the ? that the former one used in a prepared i.e. washed over the ? as a crude i.e. un-worked consequently heat in the latter heterogeneous stuff soluble in water (? water extractive) is present, as the former absent – and ? in as much as the first ? for chemical excelator is ?? excel? material should be soluble.  This may explain the difference – I think it probable that thoroughly worked meat would act less exciting than less worked.
