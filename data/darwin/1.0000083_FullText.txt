May 5  My dear Dr. Sanderson  I had such a lot of letters to write that I did not at once thank you for the acid experiments, which will do splendidly to print just as you have sent them. I shall be very curious to hear about gluten which I see in Watts Chem. Dict. is a very complex product. It contains something which excites Drosera greatly, but it is not all dissolvedlike albumen.  I am now trying dentin & enamel; As far as I can yet provisionally see the secretion does not touch the enamel, but decalcifies the dentin without dissolving the fibrous tissue; but I shall know more in a week's time, when the leaves have done all that they can.  I suppose the Drosera with be beaten & that gastric juice will dissolvedecalcified fibrous tissue of bone.  I find the Drosera can do little with fibrin; but when I have written out all my notes, & see what I actually know, I will apply for some, to me, invaluable aid.  Yours very sincerely  Ch. Darwin
