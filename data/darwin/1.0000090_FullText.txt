Dear Mr Darwin,  I have just read your letter.  As Mr Huxley is coming ? this morning, it would I think be useful to ask his opinion as to the persons who ought to have the right of certifying the fitness of applicants for Licence.  I think that allpersons who occupy the position of Public Teachers in Institutions recognized by Act of Parliament should have the right to apply to the Lord President for Licence without attaining certificate as ? fitness.  Imagine for a momentDr Sharpey applying for a certificate to the President of the College of Surgeons.  Very truly yours,  JB Sanderson
