August 28th – 36 Gt Marlborough St  (Top)  I suppose you heard long ago by the papers of Henslow's good living – Is it not glorious.  I think we shall live to see him my Lord Bishop.  If so the whigs will spoil a good naturalist, but make an excellent bishop.  (Side)  Part of a letter of C Darwin's came with mine from Isle of Wight – Emma ?
