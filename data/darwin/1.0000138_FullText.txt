49, Queen Anne Street.  May 23    Dear Mr Darwin  I have no doubt that Mr. Playfair pressed upon by men whose avowed object is the suppression of science has gone too far in his direction of compromise.I am delighted therefore to think that compromise is at an end.  Its certainly a great shame that, for the sake of a popular clamour supported by no facts, it should be necessary to consent to an exact(com)ment which would make it penal to teach science in the only way that it can be taught effectively. Is it really too great a sacrifice to make. I hope that his full enquiry which will now take placewill result in the securing of the interests both of scientific teaching & scientific research. May I suggest that it would be well to send to Playfair a copy of Huxley's letter on the subject. I have written as clearly as I can & have sent him his Litchfield letters.    Very truly yours  J.M.
