Sanderson    49, Queen Anne Street  W.  May 6    Dear Mr Darwin,      I write in haste to save my pen.      I have only time to say that Lyon Playfair called on me yesterday to tell me that Lord Cardwell had accepted hisBill & undertaken to introduce it.  Lord Shaftesbury has also agreed to support it.  Playfair will himself of course take charge of it in the H of CommonsI think it probable that Dr Playfair has himself (?) but send this note in case he should not.      Very truly yours         J B Sanderson
