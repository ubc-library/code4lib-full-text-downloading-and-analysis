May 27/Down, Beckenham, Kent  My dear Dr. Sanderson  Your information is invaluable to me. For Heaven sake do not apologize for delay, for it's making me feel more guilty in having given you such immense trouble. If the fibrous basis of bone is dissolved by artificial gastric juice, & if, as I understand the gluten & the fibrin is dissolved with the fatty acids & pepsin, the ferment of Drosera must differ [consistently?] from pepsin.  Yours very truly, Ch. Darwin
