49, Queen Anne Street.  March 30    Dear Mr Darwin  I sent you the results of our experiments. I attach much more importance to those relating to the three fatty acids than to the rest. Theywere very carefully made and yielded sharply defined results.  They shew that each of these acids possesses the power of enabling pepsin to act on fibrin though in less degreethan hydrochloric acid.  If you make further experiments with the plants this summer, I would like to cheque them by comparison with pepsin digestion.     Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
