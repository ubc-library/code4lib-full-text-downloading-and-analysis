49 Queen Anne St  Saturday    Dear Mr Darwin  I have again seen L. Playfair.   He is going to going to ask leave to bring in his Bill on Monday.  He has had a meeting with Lord Hartimann, but without immediate result, i.e. Lord H has notpromised to withdraw his Bill.  He showed me his Bill this morning with the necessary procedure clauses added and the Definition Clauses relating to the     words animal & "experiment".I hope it may be successful, but am glad to feel sure that even if it is not, it will effectually bar out the other most objectionable measure.  By next year it is anticipated thateverybody will be wiser.  Very truly yours  JBSanderson
