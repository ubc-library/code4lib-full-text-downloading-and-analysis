49 Queen Anne St  April 12    Dear Mr Darwin      I write a line to say that, after seeing Mr. Litchfield this morning (he was kind enough to (?) (with?) his copy of his draft bill).  I went down with (?) to talk to Mr Simon& told him what it was proposed to do.  He made a number of suggestions which I will send to Mr. Litchfield.      Mr. Simon thinks that it wd. best promote his object, if you would see Lord Derby yourself & simply ask him to engage Mr. Crossnot to comment himself.  For his purpose it would be sufficient merely to let Lord Derby know that such a bill had been prepared & that it had received (?) concurrence of scientific men, particularly of those interested in Physiology.Mr Simon thinks that his next step would be to arrange a small Deputation to Mr. Cross, of which Deputation he would be glad to be one.      I have received the (adhesions?) of Sir (?) and Prof Garner.      Believe me ever          yours sincerely              J B Sanderson
