Down, Beckenham, Kent    My dear Dr Sanderson   I have just seen Prof Frankland and he says that he will send to you in about a week's time some proprionic and butyric acid, as well as some valeric acid, so as to complete the series, for he thinks that it might have been valeric acid instead of butyric mixed with acetic, which was indrosera; and if you will try these acids for artificial digestion I shall be very much obliged.  On my return one I will send the globulin and haemoglobin.  Yours very sincerely,  Ch Darwin  Nov 15th  2 Bryanston St.  Portman Square  (until early Tuesday morning)
