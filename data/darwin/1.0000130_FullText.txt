Wednesday, April 7    Dear Mr Darwin  I send you a fair copy of the Memorial.  We have made another copy, so that I am ready to proceed, but I think I shall do nothing more until I hear from Paget & have again seen you.  I will, if you will allow me, call  tomorrow morning.     Very truly yours  J Burton Sanderson
