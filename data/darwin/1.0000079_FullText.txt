Down,  Beckenham, Kent    My dear Dr Sanderson,  I hear from Frank the Drosera has been behaving perversely.  I write a line, as it may possibly have a bearing on this perversity, viz that the motor influence is sent from the excited gland more quickly & completely in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction in the laminae of the leaf.    [diagram with labels: longitudinal, transverse direction, footstalk]    Yours very sincerely  Ch Darwin
