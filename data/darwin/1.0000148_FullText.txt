Down Bromley Kent  July 6th  My dear Fox  I write one line to thank you for your second most kind letter.  All is going on very well.  The nurse has had it pretty severely but the crisis is over.  No one else hastaken it & I hope now will not, but we had a fear about our Governess, but she is out of house?, & we are getting less frightened & in every way, more composed.  I have been much knocked up & so has my ? dear wifebut we are now much better.  Etty is too weak to move yet: she has not even put on her clothes, but our Dr is strong for her coming? as soon as ever she can – We go first to Elizabeth Wedgewoods & then on to the sea but where is our puzzle. We ?much like S side of the Isle of Wight; but it is indispensable on account of Etty that the house shd be very near the sea, & I fear that much does not occur on account of cliffs – Shd you know anything on the head, will you let me have a ? ; but do not otherwise trouble yourself to write.  My dear Fox, with cordial thanks for all your affection.  Ever yours,  C. Darwin
