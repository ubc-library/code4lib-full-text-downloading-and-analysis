March 10th 1880 Abinger Hall, Dorking My dear Mr. Fox, I write to offer a word to thank you for your second most recent letter. I am glad that your poor father's suffering is over, & that his end was so tranquil. I have now before my eyes his bright face as a young man, so full of intelligence &I hear his voice as clearly as if he was present. Your mother must have gone through terrible suffering during his long illness. My wife joins me in saying how deeply we sympathize with her. Please believe me Yours very sincerely Charles DarwinCh.
