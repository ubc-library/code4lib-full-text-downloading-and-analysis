49 Queen Anne  April 14th 1874    Dear Mr Darwin,  I received your letter this morning.  I should think that it wd answer the purpose to write to Lord Derby for also important is that the Government should know that a bill is being sketched & that they must not commit themselves.I had a note today from Sir Robert Christison who after expressing himself very energetically on the subject of the present agitation concludes "There should be no compromise, except to forbid vivisectional demonstrations to classes, which I always thought both useless and cruel".  I have not seen Mr Huxley.The notion of an Inspector appears to me absurd.  It would be in the first place absurd to appoint one man to inspect half a dozen others of at least equal status with himself.  There is no comparison between experimentation and anatomical dissection.  Every student must dissect, but not one in a hundred need takepart in any vivisection.  Moreover an Inspector would be of no use in putting a stop to domestic experimentation.  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
