6 Queen Anne St. Sunday 9 30th My dear Sanderson I have read the two papers with the greatest interest. It is a grand discovery. If I understand rightly, you will presently have the machine for enclosing an arm & observing arterial action. Should you try any experiments with the machine, & if you think the following one worthtrying, I should be particularly glad. It is to test (as suggested by my son Frank) my hypothetical notion on the origin of blushing, namely that thinking intently about any part of the surface of the body tends to relax the arteries in that part. You wd probably think of some better scheme than I could; but I may suggest that a man's arm shd be enclosed & his attention directed intensely to his feet; & then that he shd be induced to think as intensely as possible about the whole surface of his arm. This might be perhaps best done by some hum bug, vis. by asking him to attend to anycreeping sensation, or of heat or cold, over the whole surface of the arm, asking him to declare instantly as soon as he felt any such sensation. Mr. H. (?) Holland remarked to me long ago, that if you thought intensely about any part such as a knuckle or finger, it felt cool as if a breeze were blowing on it, & if my memory does not deceive me, I tried this & found it true. Believe me Yours very sincerely, Charles Darwin
