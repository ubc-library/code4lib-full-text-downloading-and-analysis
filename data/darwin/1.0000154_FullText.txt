Down Bromley Kent  8th    My dear Fox,  I write just to say the splendid Cock had arrived, & now I have got your letter, I am most sincerely sorry, my dear old friend, at all the great suffering you have undergone.  I have always understood that lumbago & sciatica cause extreme pain. - How much illness you have had in your life, & at different times how much misery!  It is lucky, when young, that one does not foresee the future.  I do hope that the waters are so (nasty?) that they will do yougood. - We are all well here, except for my poor dear wife who is wretched (perhaps in family way) & has been wretched for weeks; & I fear that it will stop (?).  I have been working of late very hard & have now an enormous correspondence. - I think I shall make an interesting collection of domestic (?) for promises are coming in from all quarters.  This morning I heard from Rajah Brooke with promises of energetic assistance and Hon. Cl. (Nurny?) says Pigeons & Fowls are on (this?) road forme from Persia; as are others from (E. and W. superimposed?) Africa. - At the present moment I am most interested about domestic Rabbits; having just sent an angora to be (skeletonised?), & having compared a P. Santo, common, & (Hare?) Rabbit skeletons & found, I believe, most remarkable differences. - Ducks too are my delight: pray do not forget a Call Drake or Duck if you shd. have the misfortune (oh what hypocrisy!) to lose one.  Can you tell me anything about difference in habits in Rabbits?  Do you know any breed of Ducksbesides tufted, hook-billed (both of which I have had from Holland); Penguin; Call; & Black Indian or B. (Agres?) Duck. -  Even (sub?)-(?) wl. be of value to me.  On account of doubt on origin I have come to care more about them & Pigeons than about Poultry; not that I shall give up poultry. - Mr. C. Lyell was staying here lately, & I told him somewhat of my views on species, & he was sufficientlystruck to suggest, (& has since written (10?) strings to (urge?) me) to me to publish a (sort?) of Preliminary Essay.  This I have begun to do, but my work will be horribly imperfect & with many mistakes, so that I groan & tremble when I think of it.  By the way I want just to (put), as an illustration of singular (?) in organisation, that "I have been assured (by?) (?) Mr. W.D. Fry that he hasnever seen or heard of a blueish-grey cat which was not deaf." may I quote you? or must I put in "friend".  Do you still believe in the generality of fact?  Might I say that you have seen or heard of as many as 6?  But please mind, do not answer this note if it pains or troubles you. - I do mosttruly regret that you were not able to pay us a visit; I shd. have so much enjoyed it. -       My dear (old?) friend      Yours most (tly?)         Ch. Darwin    I have sent you a very long note all about myself. - And now to write to Borneo & the Cape of Good Hope!The Rev W. Darwin Fox  Old Parsonage  High Harrowgate    C Darwin June 10/56
