49 Queen Anne St  Wednesday Ap 28    Dear Mr Darwin   I have put myself into communication with L Playfair but have not yet received his answer.   I have taken no further steps about his petition.  All who have signed it at my insistence have done soon the understanding that it would not be presented unless an objectionable bill were actually introduced.  In the meantime I will take no further steps without communication with you.   I will write again as soon as I have seen Playfair.  Yours very truly,  JB Sanderson
