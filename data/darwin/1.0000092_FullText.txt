Down,   Beckenham, Kent.  Sept 14th  My dear Dr. Sanderson  I have been extremely glad to hear what Frank has told me, and I am very much obliged to you for having allowed him to aid you.  It seems a "fine" discovery, and I should think would lead to much further research; I am very glad that you are going to report on it to the Brit. Assoc.Thanks for the paper which I will keep for a week or two, as I find I only have the second part.  And now- I am going to beg a favour of you which I stand in great need of viz. a small quantity of a few pure animal substances, namely fibrin, albumin, mucin, or any others which are tolerably distinct.  Perhaps you could persuade Dr Brunton to aide me in this; of fibrin I want for a distinct and special purpose nearly a drachm but of other substances much less; thefibrin must be absolutely pure of all salts for the special purpose in view- i.e. to excite acid secretion & get the acid ascertained.  Frankland is away, Miller is dead, and Hoffman at Berlin and I now know noone else to whom to apply.  Do you know any professional chemist whom I could pay and who could be trusted to prepare such substances pure?  The reason of my wanting these substances is, that I find absolutely pure gelatine formerly given me by Hoffman, does not cause Drosera to be inflected, though ? does.  Again as far as I havegone (though my experiments are not completed), neither casein nor gluten (from wheatflour) affects drosera.  As meat of all kinds, dead insects of all kinds, and white of egg all act most energetically, I am very anxious to know what pure animal compounds will act â€“ it seems even possible !!! that this subject might throw a little light on animal digestion, for I see old Muller suspects that something more than gastric juice is required to digest certain animal substances.  Yours very sincerely  Ch. Darwin
