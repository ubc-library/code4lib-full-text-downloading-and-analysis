Down, Beckenham, Kent  Railway Station  Orpington S.E.R.    Feb.10.75    My dear Dr. Sanderson,    Do you by any chance know whether animals can digest or decompose phosphate of potassium so as thus to obtain phosphorus?  I ask because (the?) phosphates of soda, lime, & ammonia act most powerfully on Drosaea, whereas phosphate of potassium is as innocent as gum or sugar.  I wrote some little time ago to Huxley, suggesting that Physiologists& biologists should petition the H. of Commons to pass a reasonable act on vivisection, in the spirit of the Liverpool Brit. Assoc. resolutions.  He said he would consult you; & I hope that you think well of the suggestion, & that something of the kind, or something better, will be done.  I feel very anxious on the subject, for the sake of the grand Science of Physiology, & especiallyas an enactment advised by leading Physiologists would have much moral influence on students and others.      Pray believe me          Yours very sincerely      Charles Darwin
