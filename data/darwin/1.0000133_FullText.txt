49, Queen Anne Street.  March 23    Dear Mr Darwin    My very best thanks for the M. S. It will be invaluable to me.  We are just now, many winter lectures at University College being over, looking forward to spending a week among the spring flowers. We shall take the M.S. with us.And my wife will read it to me just as you propose or perhaps I shall read it & dictate notes to her.  Please thank your son Frank for his kind offer of help of which I shall certainly avail myself.  All the experiments about digestion are com-plete. I will try to send them tomorrow.  Believe me,  Very truly yours  JB Sanderson
