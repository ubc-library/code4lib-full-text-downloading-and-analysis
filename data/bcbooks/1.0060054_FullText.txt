1o the B. W. Grand Lodge of British Columbia:
Officers and Kepresentatives :
In accordance with our laws we have assembled here on
our Fourth Annual Communication. Another year has gone,
another cycle in the events of time has passed, another period
in our history has arrived, and we have met to review the
events of that period, and to take counsel for the future.
Let Wisdom guide our deliberations; let Love and
Charity control our actions; let Peace and Goodwill reign
amongst us, and while we congratulate one another, and
grasp  each  other's  hand  in  warm   brotherly greetings, it98
behoves us to render thanks to our Heavenly Father for
his past mercies towards us, and to invoke His blessing
and guidance in the future.
I now submit for your consideration my official acts during
the year.
April 16—I caused Dispensation to be issued to all the
Subordinate Lodges in this jurisdiction, to celebrate the
fifty-eighth Anniversary of the establishment of our Order in
America.
June 4—Granted dispensation to New Westminster Lodge
No. 3 to hold a picnic in the name of the Order, and appear
in regalia at the same.
August 6—Granted Dispensation to all Lodges in Victoria
to appear in Regalia at the public funeral of the lamented
and much esteemed Sir James Douglas.
July 2—I installed the officers of Victoria Lodge No.  1.
5— | | Dominion Lodge    "   4.
11— | | Columbia      1        "  2.
Granted Dispensation to Dominion Lodge No. 4 to have an
excursion in the name of the Order, September 6th.
I may here state that it afforded me much pleasure in acced-
ingio the wishes of these Lodges as these reunions have a tendency to draw closer the bonds of Friendship and Love
among the Brotherhood and their families, and to bring the
Order more prominently before the notice of the public.
Jan. 2, 18*78—Installed officers of Columbia Lodge, No. 2.
7,       1 I " Victoria 1   1.
Owing to sudden indisposition I was prevented from installing officers of Dominion Lodge No. 4; but our R. W. G. Secretary, being always on hand, kindly performed that pleasing
duty for me.
Oct. 24, 1877—I received a communication from D.D.G.M.
E. Quennell, District No. 3, asking for information concerning
the re-admission of an expelled member. I gave him the
information as follows, and referred to law on the subject.
Nanaimo, October 24, 1877.
To the G. M., I. O. O. F.,
Dear Sir and Brother,—I wish you would be kind enough to inform m e if
a brother expelled from the order, and applying again for admission is elected,
if he has to pass through all the same forms and pay the same fees for initiation and degrees as any other candidate; for, according to our laws, I understand he has, but some of the Victoria brethren think different. By doing so
you will oblige yours in F,, L. and T.
E. QUENNELL,
D. D. G. M. of No. 5.99
Victoria, November 25, 1877.
Mb. E. Quennell,
Dear Sir and Brother,—Yours of 24th ult. to hand, asking for information
about re-adtnission of an expelled member; I beg to answer as follows:
1. A lodge has no power to re-admit an expelled member without permission from the G. L.    (See Digest, 1874, page 357, Art. 1686 a.)
2. The amount to be charged for re-admission rests with the lodge in the
absence of any legislation of Grand Lodge on the subject.
3. If re-admitted, he then assumes his former status in the order that he
enjoyed at the time that he was expelled, without going through any forms.
R. ROBERTS,
R. W. G. M.
I would submit to your consideration the advisability of
conferring the necessary power on the Grand Master to enable
him to grant permission if applied to during recess in such
matters, as it would be very inconvenient to be compelled to
wait perhaps eight or ten months, as the case might be, for
the'Grand Lodge to meet.
From the D.D.G.M.'s I have received very encouraging reports. That peace and harmony prevails among the Brotherhood, and that in view of the financiM and industrial depression
that has overshadowed our Province, our Order has not only
held its own, but is steadily gaining strength, numerically
and financially.
Bro. Chas. Hayward, D. D. G. M., of District No. 1, reports the following question having been submitted to him
for his decision:
"Whether it is the duty of a N. G., to call the brethren
together to attend the funeral of a brother who was not entitled to benefits, and whether brothers not attending should
be fined.
Answer:—"That the propriety of extending funeral honors
to brothers in arrears, is a matter for regulation by the local
laws. (See Digest 669.) And as your By-Laws, Art. 24, very
clearly defines it to be the duty of the N. G., on the death of
a brother to summon every member to attend the funeral, and
that abseniees are to be fined, I am of opinion that your
Lodge should be called out to attend the funeral of a brother
not entitled to pecuniary benefits."
Two appeal cases have been sent in and placed in the hands
of the Appeal romrnittee, who, I feel confident, will give the
different questions involved their most earnest consideration,
before submitting them to this G. L.
The G. L., U. S., at its last session, having adopted a
parade regalia for subordinates, and having left the choice of
head dress, whether hat or cap, to the various jurisdiction, I
would suggest the advisability of some
this G. L.
action being taken
h
gpci
MXiXZlfiZ'!100
And the time having nearly arrived when, according to our
laws, I shall restore back to you the charge with which you
honored me at the last meeting of this G. L., I beg to return
you my sincere thanks for the honor confered and confidence
in me, also, to my deputies, for their valuable aid in the duties
of their offices.
Also, to our R. W. G. Sec, for his uniform kindness and
valuable assistance and advice on all and any occasion re-
quired.
And again thanking you for your kindness and indulgence,
I remain
Tours Fraternally,
E. ROBERTS,
Grand Master.
Moved by J. S. Drummond, P. G. M., Rep. of No. 1, That
the report be received, ana a committee of three be appointed
to distribute to the different standing committees, subjects in
Grand Master's report, seconded by Rep. Elliott, of No. 3,

Names of Subordinate Lodges, with the number of Representatives each is
entitled to at the present session of this R. W. Grand Lodge.
Victoria Lodge, No. 1 12 Representatives.

New Westminster Lodge, No. 3     4 "
Dominion Lodge, No. 4 4 "
Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5 4 "103
At the last session of this R. W. Grand Lodge, I was instructed to forward a
petition to the G. L., U. S., for a refund of tax paid, and also to ask that we
be exempt from the payment of tax until this Grand Lodge had 10 subordinates.
This petition was forwarded and read in the G. L., U. S., and referred to the
Committee on Finance, but I am sorry to have to report that no further action
was taken in the matter. I have no doubt, however, it will be brought up at
the next annual session in September.
I was also instructed to write to the executors of the late Grand Secretary
Johnston, of San Francisco, for the name of the Brother, and specific charges
against him, which had been referred to in a letter placed before the Committee on Appeals in another case. This, I have to report, I carried out, but
without being able ever to get "a reply to my letter.
During the year I am glad to report I was able to obtain a good stock of supplies, sufficient to last for a considerable time, and have paid for the same out
of the funds of the Grand Lodge, but I would call your attention to the fact
that there is no office for the Grand Secretary, and consequently the documents
and all supplies are now placed wherever I can get room to put them; this
state of things should be altered by this Grand Body making provision at the
present session, for each year it is getting worse; papers accumulate, and when
any supplies, etc., are required, it is a difficult matter to lay hands on what is
wanted.
I received during the year papers regarding appeal of Samuel Sea v. Columbia Lodge, No. 2, and Caleb 'Colmer v. Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5; these
documents I handed to the Committee on Appeals, who will no doubt report
upon the same—in the former case I have just received a communication from
the appellant asking to have action by this Grand Lodge laid over, owing to
his absence, and for reasons set forth therein, which I lay befare you.
I also received notice of an appeal from Bros. Adam Jackson and Wm.
Litster, of New Westminster Lodge, No. 3, but have received no documents
regarding the case.
I received amendments to By-Laws of Victoria Lodge, No. 1, and New
Westminster Lodge, No. 3, which I handed to the Chairman of Committee on
Laws of Subordinates, they have not returned any amendments approved to
me, and I presume are keeping the same for the approval of the Grand
Lodge.
From the returns of the Subordinate Lodges, I find there is a small gain in
membership of eight during the past year, this I can say is more than I expected, owing to the very great depression in almost all trades in the Province
during the past year, had this not been the case, some new lodges would have
come into existence, there being several good fields for starting lodges, but the
great depression kept many back, as they really felt undecided whether to remain or leave the country; this state of matter is, I trust, over, and the present
year seems to be a commencement of more prosperous times.
As usual I have had a large amount of correspondence to attend to during
the year, but there is nothing to bring before you for action, except what I
have already reported.
Annexed you will find abstracts of reports of Subordinate Lodges, to be appended to the proceeding of the session when printed.
Fraternally submitted,
JAMES D. ROBINSON,
Grand Secretary.
Communication from Bro. Samuel Sea, of Columbia Lodge,
No, 2, referred to in Grand Secretary's report, read as follows :

. Victobia, B. C, Jan. 25th, 1878.
J. D. Robinson, Esq.,
R. W. G. Segeetaey to R. W. G. L., of B. C, I. 0. 0. F.,
Sie and Beothee: As I believe that my appeal from the action of Columbia
Lodge. No. 2, I. 0. 0. F., will come before the Grand Lodge at its next session,
I have taken the liberty of addressing you respecting it.
I applied for a copy of. the reply of Columbia Lodge to my appeal, but was
very unjustly refused.
Now, as I shall be unable, through other engagements, to be,present at the
Grand Lodge Session, and am not aware of the nature of the replies of Columbia Lodge, but from what I hear believe that a wrong impression may be.drawn
from the nature of that reply. I have therefore, in justice to myself, to ask
that a copy of said reply be furnished to me by the Grand Lodge, in order that
no injustice may be done.
I have also to ask that no decision be arrived at by the Grand Lodge until I
have examined the reply of Columbia Lodge, and if necessary, entered my
reply thereto.
I herewith enclose the medical certificate of my attending physician, in support of the justness of my appeal.
Respectfully submitted in F. L. and T.,
SAMUEL SEA.
Moved by Rep. Goode, of No. 4, That the matter of Samuel
Sea v. Columbia Lodge, No. 2. be laid over until next session.
Seconded by Eep. Jeffree, of No. 2, and carried.

Report from Committee on Distribution read as follows:
To the R. W. G. Lodge op B. C.:
Your Committee on Distribution of Grand Master's report, would most respectfully submit, that so much of the report as relates to decisions of G. M.
and Deputies of this jurisdiction, be referred to Committee on State of the
Order.
Further, so much of the report as refers to granting extra power to the
Grand Master, as also regarding head dress, be referred to Committee on Legislation.
The appeal cases spoken of in the report, apparently have already been
submitted to Committee on Appeals by the Grand Secretary, who no doubt will
in due time report on same, we find further distribution unnecessary, and
recommend the adoption of all other matters contained therein.
J. S DRUMMOND,
H. V. EDMONDS,
H. ELLIOTT.
Which was on motion adopted and handed to the different
Standing Committees as recommended.
Report of  Speci il Committee  appointed last session on
Relief Association read:
Victobia, Feb. 6th, 187
To the R. W. Gband Lodge op Beitish Columbia.
Deab Sibs and Beothebs. Your committee, appointed at the last session of
this R W. G. L., on that part of the M. W. G. M's. report recommending the
formation of a Relief Association in this jurisdiction, have collected as much
information as they could on the subject, and are of opinion that it would not
be advisable to commence a Mutual Life, or Widow and Orphan Relief Association, at the present time in this jurisdiction.

J. WRIGLESWORTH,

Moved by Rep. Elliott, of No. 3, that the report be
received, suggestion adopted, and committee discharged;
seconded by Rep. Goode, of No. 4, and carried.
Report from Special Committee on Fines, Fees, etc., read:
To the R. W. Gband Lodge of B. C.:
Your special committee, appointed to examine into subordinate constitution
in regard to fines, fees, dues and benefits, beg to make report on the subject,
that so situated as the Grand Lodge is this session, two of the special committee, viz.: P. G.. J. Davies and P. G., J. Wriglesworth, being unfortunately
absent, we have not as a whole come to any conclusion, but under the eircum-
stanc js, this being a very important matter, we consider it would be better to
continue the committee.    We therefore ask for further time,
J. S. DRUMMOND.
W. J. JEFFREE.
Moved by Rep. Loye, of No. 4, that further time be granted.    Seconded by Rep. Elliott, of No. 3, and carried.
Report of Committee on Appeals, in the case of C. Colmer
v. Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5, read.
Bbo. Caleb Colmeb o. Black Diamond Lodge.
We, the undersigned, Committee on Appeals, beg leave to report that we
have carefully examined into the case of Bro C. Conner's appeal from the
decision of Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5, I. O. 0. F., and recommend that
the appeal of Bro. C. Colmer be sustained, on the following grounds:
1. That the name of the brother preferring the charge must be attached to it,
and a copy thereof furnished to the accused; see Article 7, section 3, Constitution of Subordinates, which in this case appears not to have been complied
with.
2. That the accused must be tried by a full committee of five; in this case
the report is signed by only four members.
3. That the ballot on penalty was taken irregularly, it must be left with the
members to write on their ballots what penalty prescribed by law they think
adequate to the offence; see proceedings of Grand Lodge of B. C, 1877, in the
case of appeal, Bro. P. G. Harris vs. Dominion Lodge, No. 4.
4. That suspensions must be fixed for a definite period; see Article 7, Section

5. That the lodge was in error in passing sentence on the brother on mere
circulating reports which were not supported by any evidence, as the trial codqj
mittee in their report admit that there is no evidence before them proving the
accused guilty of the charge of adultry. Your committee therefore take the
most charitable view of the case and give the accused the benefit of the doubt,
and therefore recommend that the appeal of Bro. C. Colmer be sustained, and
the decision of Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5, I. O. 0. F., be set aside.

was subsequently forwarded by Bro. Sec, under seal of the lodge to the D. D.

Bro. P. G. Scott on May 17th, and although we protested against such action
as being illegal, the lodge, by vote, instructed the secretary to return the appeal to us to do what we liked with, which was done, unaccompanied by

To the N. G., V. G., Oppicebs and Bbethben,
New Westminsteb Lodge, No. 3, I. O. O. F.:
We. the subscribers, hereby give notice of appeal against the action of this
Lodge iu the matter of dthholding Past Grand W. J. Armstrong's benefits
daring his sickness in Victoria, to the decision of the Worthy Grand Lodge of
British Columbia, on the following grounds:
1 st. That the brother wa •* reported sick in the usual form; had drawn ben*
efits on that report, and was not reported well to this Lodge previous to his
departure for Victoria.
2d. That the brother was declared by the Permanent Secretary to be in good
standing in every way at the time he was taken sick.
3rd. That the Lodge, through the N. G., distinctly admitted its knowledge
of the brother's sickness and inability to attend to his business during the
time for which benefits are claimed.
And farther, we respectfully request an answer to the following question:
If a brother be in receipt of a certain pecuniary income during a time of
sickness, although he be incapable of attending to the business which commands said income, is he therefore disqualified from receiving sick benefits as
allowed by the By-Laws of this Lodge?
Yours faithfully, in F. L. and T.,

Whether it is the duty of the N. G. to call the brethren to attend the

To the R. W. G. Lodge of B. C:
Your Special Committee halving taken all the available evidence at hand
in regard to the above case, and the facts appearing as follows, viz.: The appellants applied for sick benefits for W. J. Armstrong, P. G.; the lodge, by
their minutes, refused to pay, by a vote of 5 to 2. The appellants appealed
from decision of lodge. Said appeal was sent to Grand Lodge through the
D. D. G. M.   The appeal in this case was not well taken; the appeal should115
have been direct to D. D. G. M. for his decision on a question of law.. The
whole matter is informal, and the fault lays—1st, by the appellants; 2nd, by
the Lodge; and, 3rd, by the Secretary of N. W. Lodge, No. 3. The appellants
should have, in their written appeal, made a direct appeal to the D. D. G. M.
The lodge should, if their appeal was irregular, so stated to the appellants
and remedied same; if the lodge neglected so to do, the Secretary, in making
out the documents, should have informed the lodge of the informality; and all
communications laid before us were without the seal of the lodge, and consequently could not be recognized by this Grand Body.
We, therefore, beg to refer the whole matter back to the lodge for proper
action,
