The New Vancouver Coal Mining a Land Go.
(LI]VIITED)
Formerly the Vancouver Coal Company,
ARE THE LARGEST COAL PRODUCERS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.
NANAIMO COAL       SOUTHFIELD COAL
(Used principally for Gag and Domestic Pmrposes.)
(Steam Fuel.)
PROTECTION ISLAND COAL and the NEW WELLINGTON COAL,
(House and Steam Coal), are mined by this Company exclusively.
The Nanaimo Coal gives a large percentage of gas, a high illuminating power, unequalled by any other bituminous coal in the
world, and a superior quality of coke.
The Southfield Coal is now used by all the leading steamship lines on the Pacific.
The New Wellington Coal, which was introduced in 1890, has already become a favourite fuel for domestic purposes. It is a
clean, hard coal, makes a bright and cheerful fire, and its lasting qualities make it the most economical fuel in the market.
The Protection Island Coal is similar to the New Wellington Coal. This coal is raised from submarine workings under the
Gulf of Georgia and is shipped from wharves both at Protection Island and Nanaimo.     /*&
The several mines of the Company are connected with their wharves at Nanaimo, B©|arture Bay and Protection Island, where
ships of the largest tonnage are loaded at all stages of the tide.   Special deepatch'giveii to1 mail and ocean steamers.

GOLD.
Gold-bearing lodes are now being prospected in many parts
of the province, and at Rossland magnificent ore-chutes of
very profitable gold-copper ore are being mined and smelted,
he Le Roi having paid to date $725,000 in dividends, with a
large and increasing amount of ore in sight as the workings
attain greater depth, while systematic development on other
properties is meeting with excellent results, mining having just
fairly begun in this camp. Little doubt can be entertained that
Rossland will become a heavy producer of gold, and that excellent properties now only await sufficient and abundant
capital to become paying mines, to further aid in which the
facilities for cheaper transportation and smelting are being
now supplied. At Nelson and at Fairview, Camp McKinney,
Greenwood, Central and other camps in the southern part of
Tale, important work is being done on the quartz ledges there,
several new mills being under erection.
Exploratory work has also been in progress in Bast Kootenay
and in Lillooet, Alberni, and on the Gulf Islands and along the
ccast line of the Mainland, as well as in other parts of the
province.
In Cariboo, several large undertakings, involving a large
amount of capital, are at work exploring both modern and
ancient river channels, the Cariboo Hydraulic Mining Co.. on
the Quesnelle River, proving, on development, to have in a
channel of the latter kind, a great deposft of exceptional richness, while other parts of this district now offer every inducement to  capital.
Into Cassiar, Omineca, and the great area to the north, as
well as Cariboo, there now promises to be a great exodus of
explorers, excited by rich diggings now being mined in the
Yukon as on the Klondyke, to the north, and rivers and creeks
long reported to be gold-bearing will now be made accessible,
and well tested.
SILVER-LEAD.
Despite the drop in the price of silver, the Slocan mines are being
much more extensively worked, while the shipments of high grade ore
are constantly increasing. The production for 1897 has much exceeded
that of 1896, as such mines as the Payne, Ruth, Whitewater and other
mines increased their output.
At Nelson, theJ3ilver King or Hall Mines are shipping constantly a large amount of silver-copper ore, and the Lardeau,
Trout Lake, Illecillewaet districts, on further exploration,
promise to become rich. In East Kootenay large bodies of
silver-lead ore will be mined on completion of the railroads
now under construction.
COPPER.
Copper is being produced to a limited extent at Rossland and
Nelson, but the large deposits of at present low grade on <n
the Boundary Creek district will be fully tested when the railroad, now almost assured, is constructed. Prospecting is
being done at Kamloops. along the west coast of the Mainland
and of Vancouver Island, as well as at many other points, and
Texada is producing high grade bornite ore.
COAL AND COKE.
The large eoUeries on Vancouver Island are producing about
a million tons of coal annually, and at Comox an excellent
coke is now being produced, much of which is shipped to the
inland smelters. The great deposits of coking coal in Bast
Kootenay, at the Crow's Nest Pass, are now being opened, as
the C.P.R. is now being built to the Columbia River to supply?)
the great mining regions with cheap coal and coke.
SMELTERS AND RAILROADS.
The smelting industry is now beginning to assume large proportions, as preparations are being made to treat the ores of
this Province within her own borders, a most important factor
in the increasing prosperity of this country, entailing as it
does, and will, the employment of much capital and many
men. The extension of the railroad systems to different parts
is now in progress, and the next few years will see many parts
in which the prospects for good mining are excellent, made
easy cf access, while Ores can be shipped with facility to the
smelting centres, where the assembling of the various inter-
fluxing ores will make possible the treatment of all British!
Columbia ores at home.
CAPITAL.
Capital can now find here excellent and many opportunities
for   investment,   if proper  business  care  and  the  experience.;
of qualified men are utilized, as the values placed on mines and
undeveloped properties have reached a reasonable basis.
MINERAL LANDS.
Mineral lands are open to location to any person over eighteen years of age, who has obtained a free miner's certificate,
and perfect title to lode claims can be easily secured after $500
worth of work has been done per claim. A great extent of
territory has yet to be prospected.
YUKON GOLD FIELDS.
As the Klondyke and other gold fields in the Yukon in British territory are reached mostly via British Columbia, all supplies and outfits obtained at Victoria, Vancouver, Ashcroft,
Kamloops, etc., can be taken in free of duty, which otherwise
will have to be paid if not purchased in Canada.

THE MONTH.
COMPLAINTS emanating from certain sections of
the Province,—notablv Kamloops, Illacillawaet
and the East Kootenay districts—have been freely
made anent the scanty information contained in the
recently issued Report of the Minister of Mines, relative to the progress of the past year's
the de-    mining in  these   camps.    All sorts of
parTMENT extraordinary motives are imputed to the
of mines   head of the department as accounting for
and its    this apparent neglect; then we are told
critics     that the volumimous returns sent in by
the Mining Recorder at Kamloops were
not included in the Departmental Report for political
reasons, and again, an anonymous correspondent in a
Fort Steel journal charges the Minister of Mines, who
it is true holds large interests in East Kootenay, as
wanting in business ability because so little attempt
was made through the Report to ' 'coerce attention to
this district in order to assist the sale of the produce of
the coal fields and enhance their values.''   All this is
very absurd.    The people of the districts referred to
may and perhaps have reasonable grounds for complaining that the space devoted in the Report of the
Minister of Mines to their mineral resources of these
particular sections of the Province was inadequate.
But, admitting this to be the case, an explanation will,
we think, be not difficult to find.
The entire work of compiling last year's Report was
in the hands of one man.    Mr.  Carlyle who lately

THE MINING RECORD.
occupied the office of Provincial Mineralogist, had the
difficult duty to perform of not only preparing reports
upon several important mineral sections of the Province
which during the previous summer he had not visited
and examined, but he had also to edit the 1 eturns sent
in by Gold Commissioners and Mining Recorders
from those districts which with the time at his
disposal he had not been able to reach. Now
it is a fact which there can be no object in
attempting to conceal, that in a majority of
cases these gentlemen holding official positions are
not in any correct acceptance of the term mining
experts, and some of their reports published in the
past have been ludicrous and unreliable in the extreme.
It is therefore to be presumed that if portions of the
entire returns submitted by Recorders to the Department were eliminated from the Report, it was because
in the j udgement of the Provincial Mineralogist—one of
the most eminent authorities on mining in Canada, by-
the-way—the statements contained therein were untrustworthy, and to amend them would have necessarily considerably delayed the publication of the report
itself.
We do not for a moment pretend to say that this is
a satisfactory state of things, or that the deficiencies in
the Mine Department's Report with regard to certain
districts are wholly condonable. But it is only fair to
point out, in view of the criticisms that have been
made, that it is manifestly unfair to expect from the
work of one man, however capable, results one might
reasonably look for from the combined labour of several. Practically speaking there are barely more than
six months in the year when it is possible to examine
undeveloped mine properties in the interior, and that
in this short space ot time Mr. Carlyle should have
visited and remained long enough to enable him to
report as he did intelligently upon such large districts
as Cariboo, Trout Take, Boundary Creek and Texada
Island, is itself a creditable record. If an official
report of a mining district is to be considered worth
the paper it is written on, it is absolutely essential that
it should bear the signature of a reputable expert. To
-issue reports annually concerning each district, would
necessitate therefore the engagement of a large staff of
expert mineralogists, which, under the circumstances,
would be something of an expensive luxury wherein
to indulge on the part of the Province.
Meanwhile, it might be very well suggested that
more in the way of geological survey work, with
special reference to mining possibilities, could be done
in this country by that useful scientific department
under Dr. Dawson's supervision at Ottawa. But if
the truth be told in the publications dealing with
British Columbia, issued by the Geological Survey of
Canada heretofore, by far too much attention and space
has been devoted to the purely scientific rather than
the practical side of the geological investigations—
that is, if one compares these reports with those published by like institutions established in several of the
neighbouring States of the Union.
The acting Secretary of the Chamber of Mines,
recently organized in Vancouver, ha£ addressed this
month a circular letter to the provincial mining press
asking for support on behalf of that newly-fledged
institution. The responses, however, to his appeal,
we regret to note, have generally been wanting in
heartiness and cordiality of tone; and, unhappilv, there
is now no disguising the fact that outside of a by
no means inclusive circle of Vancouver mining men
and brokers, the Chamber is regarded with disfavour.
This is all the more lamentable because
chamber   there is ample scope and large opportun-
of mines'  ity for an institution of the kind to per-
tjnpopu-    form useful and necessary work in the
LArity.     advancement and interests of the province.    The present unpopularity of the
new organization may easily be accounted for, and possibly, therefore, it is not too late to remedy matters.
As we pointed out once before—shortly after, in fact,
the idea of establishing a Chamber was mooted—the
success and popularity of the venture would depend
entirely upon the spirit in which it was undertaken,
and the efforts made at the outset to establish it upon
a broad provincial basis.    But almost from the inception the Chamber has been regarded in the Kootenays
as  a local  Vancouver  affair,   and  consequently up-
country mining men have held aloof.    To make matters worse, there is now a strong suspicion in Vancouver itself that the organization is being '' run '' for
the private advantage of a certain clique.      We should
be sorry to believe that there was any foundation for
so disgraceful a rumour as this, but it certainly would
never have received credence, nor, indeed, have originated at all, if steps had been taken in the first place
to obtain the consent of reprentative men from all
sections of the  province  to act as members of the
executive council.
Meanwhile, the B.C. Mining Institute, formerly the
Association of Mining Engineers, is still in existence,
and has much the same raisen d'etre as the Chamber
of Mines, but the former has the advantage already of
a fairly large and representative membership, and its
officers, elected at the last annual meeting, in February, include some of the best known mining men of
the country. Notwithstanding this, however, the
Institute cannot be charged with possessing a superabundance of energy, and its influence, which might
be v.ery great, is never exerted. The difficulty, of
course, now, is that men of any professional standing
as mining engineers have not sufficient time to devote
to work of this kind, and mine managers and owners
have been strangely indifferent. Nevertheless, a time
has arrived when, in the interests of legitimate mining,
organization and action on the part of the leading
representatives of the industry in the province is
necessary, and it is to be hoped this fact will be
speedily realized. The amalgamation of the present
Chamber of Mines with the Mining Institute might,
perhaps, be satisfactorily accomplished, and at any
rate the matter is worthy careful consideration. It is
quite likely that if this plan were adopted, the result
would be the establishment of a strong and responsible association which would ultimately become a
powerful factor in promoting the welfare of the mining industry in British Columbia.
As a general thing, when a measure has, as it were,
successfully  run the gauntlet of the Parliamentary
Railway Committee at Ottawa, its worst troubles are
over, and its passage through the House
DEFEAT of of Commons may be considered as toler-
the        ably  assured.    In the case of Mr. Cor-
KETTivE     bin's application for permission to build

by that body by a large majority, only,' however, to
be rejected in the House by an adverse vote of
64 to 44. The Toronto Globe ascribes the defeat of
the Bill to a " powerful and persistent lobbying " on
the part of its opponents and the C.P.R. agents, but
whatever the cause the effect is none the less deplorable, as precluding the possibility of railroad competition in South Yale, unless, indeed, Mr. Corbin refuses
to admit that he is beaten, and is able to find a suitable pass over which to build a railway from Marcus,
Washington, to the international boundary at Midway
without entering Canada at all. If he can carry out
this intention the Government will have reason to
regret the recent defeat of the Kettle River Railway
Bill. Had Mr. Corbin's application been granted, he
would have been bound, by a provision of the Bill to
charge no higher rate for the carriage of Boundary
Creek ores to Canadian than to American smelters,
and his line would have been more or less under our
own control. Now, however, if the engineering difficulties of railroad construction from Marcus are found
to be not insurmountable—and from some knowledge
of the country we are inclined to believe that they are
not—an American railroad will be built to the boundary and operated in strictly American interests, and
thus, if Mr. Corbin can, by offering a specially low
nearly $2o,ooo, or almost $10,000 a charter, was made,
whilst in other instances the gains of Provincial railroad chartermongers have been far larger. If, as is
certain, Provincial railroad charter rights have such
very substantial selling values, the thought suggests
itself that Acts conferring these special privileges
might well call for substantial money payments from
the grantees to the Provincial Treasury in sums proportionate to the estimated market or speculative
worth of the charter granted. -
The statutory meeting of that extraordinary organization the Klondike Hydraulic, Limited—which owns
no properties whatever in the Klondike, but has
instead very doubtful gold gravel assets in Alaska—
was lately held in London, England. It was then
reported that the vendor, who, according to the
original prospectus, "threw into the bargain" a
large quantity of gold which the property had previously yielded, was taking (because compelled to do so
by the natural coyness of British investors with regard
to new schemes) '' the whole of his consideration in,
ordinary shares," with however, the notable "exception of promotion fees," doubtless substantial. Meanwhile the chairman of the meeting, a gentleman
named Pye,  said that all the preference shares were

haulage rate, secure the smelting of the higher grade
ores of the Boundary Creek camps at Northport, he is
very likely to adopt this course. So much for the
defeat of the bill on patriotic grounds. Nevertheless,
its an ill wind that blows nobody good, and the fight
over this measure at Ottawa has at least resulted in a
definite promise from the C P.R. that immediate steps
would be taken by the company to provide the Boundary Creek district with railroad facilities.
Railroad charter-selling still continues to be the
order of the day, as regards franchise concessions that
have long been too unconditionally granted by our
Provincial Legislature. Thus, at a recent general
meeting in London, England, of the London & Vancouver Finance & Development Company, Limited,
Sir Edward Thornton, the chairman, stated that
"owing to the smallness of the company's working
capital they had been obliged to dispose of the two
railway charters they had obtained in British Columbia, but by the transactions they had made a cash
profit of over ,£4,000." He afterwards announced
that a dividend of 20 per cent, would be declared that
day, though "it was necessary, if the company was to
be a success in the future, that more capital should be

remember, the amount was ^52,000 or ,£53,000 out of
^60,000. Mr. Pye then told the meeting that "if the
statements of the vendor in iegard to the property-
proved correct, the necessary machinery would be in
operation by August, so that they would get one
month's work from it before the season closed." A
pretty company this, called "Klondike," because
possessed of no Klondike mining interests at all, with
its meeting presided over by a chairman who really
couldn 't remember exactly how much stock was taken
up, and with a property to be worked, if the statements of the vendor—very large, vague and dubious—
proved to be correct. The preference stockholders
must indeed be men of simple faith to invest in a
concern so organized and so run, and dependent
absolutely on the verification of an all important " if "
for any success achievable.
Now that spring has come, with its mild weather
and usual supply of bunch grass for cattle up country,
and now that river and lake navigation is about also
to open in Cassiar and the Yukon country, much
travel is making north via Eastern British Columbia,
through Ashcroft and via Lillooet and Cariboo. It is
stated that Yukon gold-seekers are leaving Ashcroft
at the rate of 450 a month, and the number taking this
well-advertised overland route, is steadily increasing.i6
THE MINING RECORD.
But Eastern Canadians will indeed be foolish if they
follow the example of a party of Montrealers bound
for the Yukon, who lately passed through Ashcroft,
after expensively outfitting at Spokane, thus adding
heavy Canadian import duties to their expenses, and a
distance of two hundred miles to their travels. Canadians and Britons should assuredly, if they be wise,
outfit in Canada, and by preference for many reasons,
in one or other of our leading: British Columbia cities.
The English capitalists who have been seeking from
the Legislature charter concessions for Queen Charlotte
Island exploitation, mining and development, are for
the time being postponing their application, desiring
to submit, as they state, another (fine and) large proposition at a future date.
Public opinion is very sharply divided over the
proposed provincial subsidy to the Mann-Mackenzie
railroad project. The sum of $i ,500,000, suggested as
the probable amouut of the subsidy, is regarded by
many as very large, and requiring, for safe securing,
as regards principal and interest, larger royalties than
one dollar a head on passenger, and fifty cents a ton
on freight traffic. Royalties of double these amounts
would certainly cause the proposed bill to be looked
upon with more favour, it being generally conceded
that quick returns must be obtained from any Yukon
railroad enterprise.
A School of Mines has been established in Rossland
under the auspices of a number of leading men of that
place, and from what we can gather the institution is
likely to become very popular in the camp. It is
probable, however, that a very large proportion of
students attending the lectures will be prospectors,
and it is rather unfortunate, therefore, that the school
was not started earlier—before, in fact, the prospecting season set in. This must not be construed as
suggesting criticism, because the enterprise of the
founders of the Rossland School of Mines is to be very
highly commended, but if this example is not followed
in other mining towns it will be owing to the fact
that the trial at Rossland was not successful from a
financial standpoint, and the reason therefor should
be prognosticated.
We have lately learned that an application has been
made to the Government by the promoters of the
Rossland School of Mines for monetary assistance, but
we doubt if this proposal will be considered unless a
guarantee is furnished that the institution will be
kept open for some considerable period of time. It
would have looked better, too, we think, if the application for aid had come after the school had become
properly established, and its utility recognized. On
the other hand, if the Provincial Government cannot
see the way clear towards establishing schools of
mines throughout the country as state institutions,
such as has been successfully done in the Australian
colonies, the next best thing is to encourage private
enterprise to take the initiative by offering as liberal a
bonus as possible for the first school of the kind
started in each camp of any importance, the money
being payable at the expiration of a specified time
after the production of satisfactory evidence that a
regular course of lectures had been delivered, and
attended by a given number of students.
Mr. Eberts, the Attorney-General, in a letter addressed to the Minister of Mines, recommends, in view
of the recent alleged scandals in connection with the
Mining Recorder's office at Granite Creek, that Government servants in the mining district offices should
be "forbidden to act as agents, with or without
remuneration, for private individuals doing business
with the offices, or to volunteer any information or
services not within the strict limits of their duties."
But it is one thing to issue instructions and another to
enforce them. Supposing the Mining Recorder in
any camp you please, discovers from his books that
Jack Smith, who is the owner of a very valuable
claim, has failed to comply with the requirements of
the law in some essential particular, and that the property is therefore forfeitable : what is to prevent him
from giving the information to Tom Jones upon the
understanding that Jones will, after re-locating the
ground, deed him, the Recorder, a half or a quarter
interest in exchange for his "tip"? And who, in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, will be the wiser?
Jones, as in gratitude bound, will say nothing about
the transaction, and while in due course the bill of
sale of the ceded interest is registered, the fact that
the Recorder has presumably purchased a share in a
mining claim will not necessarily attract attention.
If the Government is anxious to put a stop to this
sort of thing the only effective course would be to
prohibit the officials in question from acquiring mining property in the districts to which they were
appointed, increasing at the same time the salaries
appertaining to the respective offices.
M. Ogilvie, D.L.S., who is now lecturing in London
on the Yukon, has evidently and wisely recognized
that while he may hold very optimistic views concerning the mining potentialities of the Northern gold
fields, promoters of wild-cat companies will not hesitate to take advantage of his perhaps too highly
coloured utterances to serve their own ends, and he
has, therefore, we are glad to see, taken the precaution
to warn the British public in the most emphatic language, not to put money into Klondike concerns
without the most careful investigation. "There is a
' Klondike boom ' at present," Mr. Ogilvie is reported
to have said, '' and it is quite conceivable that a good
many people may burn their fingers. Several public
companies have been located of late with the object of
buying mining claims in the Yukon. Now, the vendor's title to the claims he proposes to sell, should be
subjected to the strictest examination. It is necessary
to bear the conditions which constitute a mining title
in mind. The most important of them is that every
claim must be worked continuously and 'in good
faith' during the working months. If the claim remains unworked for seventy-two consecutive hours,
the title lapses and the claim can be 'jumped.' Subject to these conditions claims may be combined,
provided the agreement is recorded." In view of the
remarks we published last month regarding the probable results of this well known lecturer's visit to England, it is eminently satisfactory to know that Mr.
Ogilvie is taking so sensible a means of discouraging,
to the best of his ability, rash speculation in Klondike
wild-cat ventures.
Mr. J. B. McArthur, President of the Rossland
Board of Trade, has liberally enough offered three
prizes of fifty, thirty and twenty dollars respectively,
for essays containing the best suggestions on " Howthe Smelting Industry of British Columbia may be
more, beneficially retained and built up in Canada
without prejudicially affecting the interests of the mine
owners." This is a hard nut to crack, and any one
satisfactorily solving so difficult a problem would truly
earn his fifty dollars.
posed new departure in British Columbia quicksilver
mining have not yet got beyond the stage of the bonding several of the more promising properties.
A correspondent writing to the Mining Record
from Rossland, states that fourteen miners were dismissed last month by Le Roi Company, for no other
reason than that they happened to be married men,
and hence refused to " board " at the mine mess house.
Comment is here quite Unnecessary.
The fearful loss of life occasioned by three separate
snowslides on the Dyea and Chilcoot trails during the
past few weeks will naturally have the effect of
■largely diverting the stream of travel to the Yukon,
at least so long as further danger of the same kind is
to be apprehended, to the rather longer but less
hazardous route by way of the Stickeen River and
Teslin Lake. Railway or no railway, this route is
infinitely the easiest and the best for summer going ;
and with the opening of the rivers to navigation this
month the journey directly to the centre of the gold
excitement will, as a matter of fact, present less hardships than are commonly faced and disregarded by
prospectors in the Kootenays at this season of the
year. Meanwhile it is a somewhat noteworthy fact
that, according to the published lists, the victims of
the fatal Dyea catastrophes were in every case American citizens.
Lord Strathcona, the Agent-General for Canada in
London, England, and his secretary, Mr. J. G. Colmer,
have lately been doing good work in exposing numbers of attempted swindles based on the Klondike
boom, and as a result the police have in several
instances taken effective action against the tricksters
concerned. These have, however, mostly been practitioners on a.small scale, their usual modus operandi
being to advertise that men were wanted for an
imaginary Yukon expedition, and secure from applicants small fees for registering their names and as
guarantees of bona fides, etc. The bigger knaves,
who have attempted to get up Klondike bubble companies, have been less easy to reach; but not very
many absolute swindles have yet been perpetrated on
the British public by that large company of fraudulent
promoters, which, to the disgrace of English law and
the discredit of the English financial world, continues
to work almost wholly unmolested in the heart of
commercial London.
Another attempt is being made to revive quicksilver
mining in the Savonas district by securing a sufficiency
of British capital to enable a consolidation of the best
cinnabar properties and work them by up to date and
economic methods. Those behind the new endeavour
assert—rightly or wrongly—that the temporary failure
of cinnabar mining in British Columbia is ascribable
to former mismanagement or incompetence, and,
moreover, assert that these operations were conducted
on mistaken lines. It is also insisted that the percentage of quicksilver in the cinnabar deposits, where
known to exist in the districts of the Province, is considerably larger than the proportion existent in the
cinnabar deposits of California, which have been
worked with profit on a large scale for more than a
generation.  \ Meanwhile the negotiations for this pro-
The rather important announcement appears in a
circular addressed to the shareholders of the British
American Corporation that the properties purchased
by the resident Director, Mr. Mcintosh, this spring,
in the province, are to be "acquired, jointly and in
equal shares with the London and Globe Finance
■Corporation, Limited." The reason given for this
departure being that the interests thus secured by the
B.A.C. are so extensive and valuable " that it would
have proved impossible for one company to handle
them singly." What, not even with an available
capital of seven millions and a half? We are more
inclined to think the B.A.C. and the London & Globe
Finance, being practically one and the same concern,
that the announcement of the alleged combination of
forces means that the London directors of these powerful syndicates are so satisfied with the opportunities
for profitable investment in B.C., that they have
decided to operate upon a larger scale than was at
first contemplated, and perhaps, therefore, there is
some truth in the rumour that negotiations have once
more been opened for the purchase of Le Roi at
Rossland. This surmise, if correct, is at least gratifying to those of us who believe in the future of this
province's mining possibilities, and it is to be expected
that with so capable and careful a man as Mr. Carlyle
to direct affairs, and under him a skilled force of
expert assistants, with the undoubtedly promising
mines and prospects that have been secured the shareholders of this octopus corporation will have reason to
be satisfied with their British Columbia investments.
Referring to 'Cospersonnel of the B.A.C. official staff
at Rossland, a very amusing incident occurred the
other day. Our contemporary and namesake, the
Evening Record, printed a leading article speaking in
highly complimentary terms of Mr. Mcintosh and his
colleagues, including Mr. Edwin Durant, the company's office manager, and a recent arrival from England. But it appears that some of the statements made
in this article displeased Mr. Durant, who is not yet
accustomed to western journalism, and so, after inviting the editor of the offending, but well-meaning newspaper to visit him at his office, he gave the unfortunate
scribe a severe scolding. Probably, however, Mr.
Durant got back worse than he gave, for the next
day, in the editorial column of the Evening Record,
the following entertaining paragraph appeared :
We still have every confidence in the B.A. corporation and
its gentlemanly officers, but we made the serious mistake of
mixing the officers' names with those of the attaches—the
chief clerk and his assistant.   We won't do it again.
To be decoyed to the office of the company in the absence of
the real officers—and with whom we have always had the most
cordial relations—in such an underhand way as was used;
berated and insulted in the ungentlemanly and contemptible
manner in which we were treated, was certainly the most low-
down trick that has ever been perpetrated upon us.
We probably deserve to be roasted for permitting ourselves
to be lured from our sanctum sanctorum by such cheap hire •
lings, but certainly not for what we wrote. It was entirely on
account of the very respectable surroundings of the individual
and our own clear conscience that put us within his reach.
A correspondent signing himself "Old-Timer,"
suggests that it will probably interest a number of the
readers of the Mining Record to learn that '' some
rich placer diggings were discovered in the bars of theTHE MINING RECORD.

thousand people made the journey thither from Victoria, in canoes, during the time of the Cassiar excitement." Doubtless the territory between Glenora and

Hootalinqua and its tributaries, will be prospected
with the best possible results, this season.
The announcement that Mr. R. D. McConnell, of
the Geological Survey, has reconsidered his decision
with regard to accepting the position of Provincial
Mineralogist, made vacant by the resignation of Mr.
Carlyle, will be received with regret by a large class of
our readers. Meanwhile it is learned that Mr. McConnell modestly concluded, after perusing the recently
issued Department of Mines Report for 1897, that he

was not sufficiently qualified as a mining engineer--
his life having been passed in the special study of
geology, upon which he is an eminent authority—to
take up the work at the point where Mr. Carlyle
left it. The Government is already in communication
with a distinguished mining engineer—whose name,
however, we are not at present at liberty to publish-
to whom the vacancy has been offered.
The C.P.R. generously furnish tickets at reduced
rates to commercial travellers visiting the mining
towns of the Province on business, and it is asked if
the same privilege could not be accorded to professional
mining men residing on the Coast, who are employed
to examine and report on properties in various and
distant parts of the country This, we think, is a
question that might well be left to an institution such
as the Chamber of Mines to deal with.
The Kootenaian, of Kaslo, whose editor, Mr. King,
is taking a pronounced part in the agitation for an
imposition of a prohibition duty on lead, in order to
build up the Province's smelting industry, questions
the accuracy of the information we published last
month, dealing with the effect a change in the tariff
as proposed would have on the salmon canning industry. Perhaps, therefore, it is allowable to state that
our authority on this point was no less a person than
the manager of Messrs. R. P. Rithet& Co., one of the
largest canning firms in the Province. We have since
learned, however, that the figures quoted were based
on last year's pack, and it may strengthen the Koote-
naian's argument to add that last year the season was
exceptionally bad in the cannery trade.
But the Kootenaian can compliment—and in, too, a
very kindly manner—as well as criticize, for it tells
its readers that " with the possible exception of the
Mining & Scientific Press (of San Francisco) which
has the advantage of being a weekly, the Mining
Record is the prince of western mining papers, and
should have the support of every miner, prospector
and business man in the country." Another paper,
the Kootenay Mail, of Revelstoke, opines that the
Record '' promises to be easily the most interesting
publication of its kind in Canada." When one is
tired of the exertion of blowing one's own horn, it is
comforting to be able to hand the instrument confidingly over to one's friends. Gentlemen, " we looks
towards you and we likewise bows."
The Trades and Labour Union of Rossland, in
endorsing Mr. Kellie's Truck Act, are but voicing the
sentiments of the majority of the public. In insisting
that the clause in that Act which allows the employer
to obtain a written agreement from his men permitting
him to deduct from the wages of the employee sums
representing board and debts due to the company'a
store be struck out, they are merely ensuring that the
whole principle of the bill will not be nullified by the
action of this proviso.
It is argued that this Act will be in contravention of!
the principle of the freedom of contract. This is an
extremely specious plea ; but as at the present, owing
to the crowded state of the labour market, there
virtually exists no freedom of contract whatsoever,.
the advancers of that plea, under the guise of principle, actually grasp at the unjust profit which the
very principle they uphold would deny them.
An attack has been made upon Le Roi Company in j
respect to its boarding house system. This mine
employs 200 men. It charges each $1 a day. Its
gross return for the month is, therefore, $6,000. The
profit is not less than $3,000. It, therefore, is in a
position to pay a good round dividend every six
months, not out of the mine,'but out of the illegitimate profit it makes out of the men. The men themselves can get "board" in the town, not a half-mile
distant, for 70 cents per diem, or, if willing to cater
for themselves, for half that amount.
But the worst offenders are the smaller men. Take
one of the subsidiary industries round a mining camp,
or a railway construction camp on the way to it. In
these cases the men are still paying $30 per mensem for
very inferior food to that supplied by the Le Roi. In
addition they are '' laid off " for many days during the
month. Often enough ten are idle days, not reckoning
the Sundays. At an average wage of $2.50 a day,
which is high pay, the employment merely means $10THE MINING RECORD.

to $15 in cash on the arrival of the monthly pay-day.
From this deduct doctoi 's fees, tobacco, and the various
necessaries purchased during the month from the employers' store, on all of which the " boss " squeezes
another profit. Should the unfortunate be married
his case becomes that of a slave, for he never will have
enough money in hand to be ahead with the world and
purchase in cash from his own choice of a store.
In Pennsylvania another iniquity is added to this,
and the mine owner sets up his own saloon, or pays
his men off in a liquor store that is in league with him.
In the-e cases it is not well with the employee if his
principles involve temperance.
We print elsewhere an interesting article by Mr.
Thos. Bateman, M.E., of Alberni, contrasting the
mining laws of this province with those in force in
the Australian colonies Some of our contributor's
suggestions are very much to the point, and we shall
be glad if they create discussion. Mr. Bateman is a
mining engineer of considerable standing in Tas-.
mania, where he has resided for upwards of 25 years.
The litigation in respect to the ownership of some
remarkably rich mining claims on Kokanee Creek, in
the Nelson Division, was brought to a head this
month, when the case was disposed of in the Supreme
Court, judgment being given in favour of defendants,
without, however, and unfortunately, perhaps, from
the point of view of the onlooker, the real issue at
stake being considered, as the plaintiffs were nonsuited on a technicality. The interest attaching to
the case rested on the following grounds: One of
the defendants, Willie, staked three adjoining claims,
the Mollie Gibson, the Florence and the Aspen, the
discovery post on the centre claim being placed on a
relatively worthless quartz showing, the end claims
being staked on a galena lead of extraordinary value.
Plaintiffs restaked the properties on the assumption
that these claims were on the same lead, and consequently invalid according to the provisions of the
" Mineral Act," which forbids a prospector to locate
more than one claim on the same vein. Expert evidence was engaged on both sides, one party desiring
to prove that the galena vein was traceable across the
ground of all three claims, and the other that the
I quartz showing on the centre claim was a true lode
and that the galena lead outcropping on the first claim
was not the same as that found on the third. The
opportunities for technical argument, it will be noted,
are here illimitable. However, the plaintiffs lost their
case owing to the fact that stone monuments had been
used instead of wooden stakes of the prescribed size to
mark out the location boundaries, but it is understood
an appeal is to be taken from this decision.
That in the legal struggle for the ownership of these
properties the game is almost worth the candle may be
inferred from the fact that another action is likely to
be brought into Court by a gentleman who had a bond
on the group for $85,000 and allowed the time to
elapse without making the necessary payments, but
who is now anxious to acquire another option on the
same terms, alleging the disputed ownership as his
excuse for refusing to meet the payments due under
the original bond. The ore of the Mollie Gibson is a
wonderfully high-grade galena, some specimens of
ruby silver from the ledge assaying as high as 10,000
oz., and the showing is reported to be greater than
anything yet discovered in the Slocan.
TERMINAL CITY TOPICS.
IT is stated that a representative of the millionaire
smelting firms  of the  Elliotts and  Vivians,  of
Swansea, is about to visit Vancouver and
various   the Coast, in order to ascertain the pos-
smei/ter   sibilities for the profitable working of a
schemes,   large ore smelter and refinery,    This is
good news for the Terminal City, as the
enquiry will be made by men who usually " mean
business." Meanwhile two other smelter propositions are more or less before the city of Vancouver.
Mr. E. Blewett and his American associates in the
Van Anda mine, .on Texada Island, state that they
intend to locate on the Coast a 100-ton smelter, for
which the machinery is, they add, already ordered and
in Seattle, en route for British Columbia. They hint
that, if encouraged sufficiently—municipally or otherwise—they may locate the smelter, for which the Van
Anda and other Coast mines would afford an ample
ore supply, in or hard by Vancouver. But a 100-ton
smelter will probably be deemed too small to be aided
by a Vancouver public subvention. Then there is
another and highly speculative proposition before the
City Council of Vancouver, made by the Anglo-
Continental Public Works Company, Limited, of
London, England. They propose to erect a 350-ton
smelter, with a small refining plant attached, if the
city will find them a free site—itself worth a big sum
and exceedingly difficult to procure in or immediately
adjoining Vancouver.
The Company asks next for tax exemption during
twenty years—another concession worth much solid
cash—and a cash subsidy during twenty years of fifty
cents a ton up to 30,000 tons of ore treated—this being
equal to a bonus of of $15,000 a year. In return, if
the Company to be established and capitalized in
,£250,000 should pay sufficiently, the City of Vancouver is, after the Company should have found 6 per
cent, interest on ,£50,000 debentures, to receive a 10
per cent, dividend on ,£5o,ooo of fully paid preference
stock credited to the city. The proposal is so largely
speculative, and asks, among other things, for a land
concession of such difficulty, that there is little likelihood of its acceptance. It will almost certainly pass
into the " limbo," whereunto are consigned quite a
number of previous smelter proposals made to Vancouver, including that of good Mr. Selover, of Seattle,
Portland and other places, and that of Mr. Symons,
Q.C., of Eastern Canada. Vancouver is, to speak
plainly, sick of resultless smelter schemes. But the
city has some faith in the possibility of practical work
in the desired direction by the great metal men of
Swansea.

said, find $100,000 for development, and

stock ; but few of those who should be "in the

the time of the opening of Northern Cassiar and Yukon
navigation, and the beginning of the Klondike summer
season.    If so, early May should witness a big revival
of Yukon trading on the Coast.    Meanwhile there is
no doubt that much Yukon travel is being diverted to

and forward a satisfactory margin in cash. Mr. Willis
anticipates a sale at "par,'' or perhaps at a rather
higher quotation, but the time is not quite yet, though
the stock of the Gold Fields of British Columbia, Limited, is quoted at something of a premium. The present market for the stock, as for that of almost every
other British Columbia mine company organized in
London, is however very limited, and £25,000 worth
of it cannot at the moment be sold to advantage.
Vancouver outfitters, shipping men and general
traders are somewhat alarmed by the temporary decline
of the Yukon excitement, and the considerable falling
off of Klondike travel via the Terminal City. Had

support a big Provincial railroad subsidy, even if it
should run to $r,500,000, saying that we must at
almost any cost have provided, without the least
avoidable delay, a distinctively all-Canadian route to
Dawson City. Vancouver shipping men, who have
lately been compelled to cut extremely close both
freight and passenger rates to Alaskan ports, take
much the same view as the merchants. On the other
hand a large body of more or less independently
inclined citizens, whose interests are not directly connected with Yukon trading or shipping, hold that the
suggested Provincial subsidy is far too large for the
means of somewhat heavily encumbered British Columbia. The same people, with whom politicians
must reckon seriously enough, hold that railroad aids
to Yukon travel should at least as liberally be aided
by the Dominion as by the Province, and declare that
it is monstrously unfair for Eastern Canadian statesmen and parliamentary members at Ottawa to seek to
shoulder most of the responsibility of providing Yukon
railroad facilities upon our young and sparsely settled
Pacific Province. Yet a third party, representing a
considerable, though not the entire labor vote of Vancouver—the Nationalists—take a stand on principle,
and declare that further Provincial aid to railroads,
whether running to the Yukon or elsewhere, must be
accompanied by corresponding state ownership pro
rata. Hence, whilst all Vancouver is interested in,
and wishes to see further railroad facilities provided
for the Yukon, the community is by no means a unit
on the issue, as regards the manner of providing ways
and means. One thing was clearly shown, however,
by the small attendance and politically neutral resolutions passed at the Vancouver citizens' meeting held
early in the month, that there is no indignation felt
by the local community at large in regard to the
Dominion Senate's rejection of the Mann-Mackenzie
railroad subsidy bargain. Most here, when regarding
the matter dispassionately and apart from considerations of keen political partizanship, agree that if the
original bargain had been ratified, the country would
"in kind," if not in cash, have paid altogether too
dearly for the proposed narrow gauge line of railroad.
It is learned that as a result of a meeting of the Vancouver City Council with Mr. H. W. Treat, a leading
director of the Van Anda Gold & Copper Company,
Limited, it is likely that the Council will pass, for
submission to the voters of the city, a money by-law
authorizing a grant of a bonus of fifty cents a ton up
to an aggregate of 100,000 tons, on all copper and
other ores treated at a smelter of 100 tons daily capacity,
which the Van Anda Company would, in the event of
the bonus by-law passing, erect on some site approved
by the Council, within five miles of the Vancouver
City limits. At some such distance, injury to vegetation and property from noxious fumes would be avoided, and there is, moreover, no available site of sufficient
size to be found within the city boundaries The
proposed smelter will probably, if Vancouver's citizens
approve the project, be built either in North Vancouver
or on the Burrard Inlet harbour front, at some point
beyond Hastings. At North Vancouver in particular,
the Van-Anda people can probably obtain a land grant
on very easy terms, some of the large owners there
being exceptionally willing to aid the local development of industrial- enterprise, with a view to a
consequent growth of townsite values.
Several interesting letters and articles, including the conclusion of Mr. Howard West's paper on "Silver Occurrence in
Kootenay," have been, for want of space, crowded out.

rPHE B.A.C. has, that which is to be expected of a
* British Company, the courage of its convictions.
It has started work. In a short time, if all goes well,
and there exists no reason to prognosticate evil, the
pay roll of the town will be doubled. At least 500
men will probably have to be engaged during the
ensuing month. It is possible, of course, that some
of the buys of the B.A.C. may turn out inferior to
expectation ; but on the whole, opinion is that good
judgment was displayed in the purchases.
the b.a.c. A mine's turn out depends largely upon
the efficiency of the superintendent. On
this score exception can hardly be taken to the
appointment of Mr. W. A. Carlyle as general superintendent. His coadjutors are such men as D. J.
Macdonald, late mining inspector, who has been
appointed to the Columbia and Kootenay mine : John
Long, who retains charge of the Josie group, and
'' Billy '' Haskins, late of the Homestake group, who
bears a well deserved reputation in and out of Rossland as a thoroughly .experienced inining man. With
plenty of funds, good officers and good property, there
exists no reason why the B.A.C. should not be a
thorough success. It cannot be denied that the
B.A.C. entered Rossland at an exceedingly opportune
moment. Hostile criticism must always be expected ;
but a good deal of it proceeds from the captiously
inclined of Spokane and Toronto. Rossland, however, is able to stand on its own feet, and is neither
an appanage of Spokane nor even of Toronto.
The strike on the Deer Park and the sale of other
properties on the south belt tends to show that Rossland not only possesses good mines on its northern
side, but is environed with excellent claims. The
" wild catter " is leaving us, but many of his million
dollar companies are stranded wrecks on our shores.
Apropos of million dollar companies, a defender of
them lately objected to a recent criticism of mine on
the matter.    He declared that everybody knew that
they were not worth a million dollars, that the widow
and orphan 110 longer existed,  and at any rate they
were no longer deceived,  having cut their wisdom
teeth.    Further,   he maintained as a  company promoter that the figure " million " was extremely convenient, being so easily divisible,  and that the real
value of the mine was to be estimated so simply by
multiplying the value of any share by a
million    million !     An illustration in point is the
dollar    Red Eagle.    That was a $1,250,000 con-
compantes, cern. Its shares were scattered broadcast over the land; the promoters
pocketed their sales and their commissions, but one
day it was declared that there were no funds, and the
company was sold out for debt last December. Now,
the property adjoining the Red Eagle, which is in the
south belt crossed by the Trail Railway, the Mayflower and the Curlew, are for sale at $150,000 and
$30,000 respectively. The latter is a mere prospect.
There is little doubt, the more especially as the ledge
of the Mayflower crosses the Red Eagle, that the
property is a really good one, spoiled merely by the
methods adopted. The Ottawa Gold Mining Company have reincorporated the mine for a nominal
capital of $230,000, divided into one dollar shares.,
Half of these shares are offered to the original shareholders at 25 cents a share, or rather, what comes to
the same thing, an assessment of five cents per share
on their old stock, which is worthless.    This is a step22

in the right direction, and is, I suppose, as good as we
can expect for the present.
A minor evil here is the habit of placing the head
office of a Rossland mining company at
company   any distance from  130 to  4,000 miles
head       away, and not even complying with the
quarters, very moderate  law which provides for
an office on the spot, where the transfer
of stock can readily be made.    This is not only a
direct injury to Rossland, but is an imposition upon
the general public.    Some companies do indeed put
up a shingle outside some grocery or another, but that
possibly proceeds from a laudable desire to save the
shareholders office rent.   Among the more conspicuous
offenders are the Le Roi, War Eagle, Iron Mask, Cliff
and Deer Park.
We also suffer from capital at the hands of unscrupulous promoters in Great Britain. A company is being
formed in Edinburgh, with a capital of ,£100,000. Its
property is some miserable prospect out of the way of
all communication, ten miles behind Sophie Mountain. Its engineer is unknown in the camp, and its
accredited agent is

serve to gull the
public and to deprecate the value of

to be seen whether the C.P.R. will really go into
that country this season, or whether it will be left to
the Spokane people to run a railway, first south of
the international boundary, and by building up a line
of towns along its course skim the cream off this exceedingly rich district.

(By Thos. Bateman, M. Aust. Inst. C. E.)
I^HAT evidence of really valuable mineral wealth
awaiting exploitation exists both in British Columbia and the North West Territory is beyond a doubt,
the production of which may, in time, equal if not exceed the output from any of the Colonies in the British
Empire. Americans from the United States are beginning to realise this, for wherever you may go you are
almost certain to meet American agents quietly buying
up partially developed mines, or securing good prospecting interests. Fortunately for us, the mineral
resources of Canada are now attracting the attention
of the world and, as a consequence, the factors required
for its development—capital and skilled labour—will
naturally be drawn to it. What, in my opinion, is
needed particularly now is wise statesmanship to so
frame the mining laws as to retain these factors permanently by the encouragement and protection of
both.    That our mining laws and  regulations require
revision, is patent
to all mining men.
The I dummying "

the development of
the country ; even
the small amount of
assessment work
necessary to hold

claims were thrown open to them to prospect, many
valuable discoveries would, I believe, result.
In Australasia there are no crown grants of mineral
areas given. All mineral claims are held under lease
from the Crown, at a rental, generally speaking, of
twenty shillings per acre per annum for gold, and five
shillings per acre per annum on other minerals, and
two shillings and sixpence per acre on coal leases.
Stringent labour conditions have to be complied with,
or the ground is liable to forfeiture at any time, by
any person applying for it. When locations are recorded, Government surveys of these are compulsory.
Rent in advance, and survey fees, (at fixed rates
under Government supervision) are deposited at the
time of recording. These surveys, when made, are
charted on the maps ot each mining district, and the
maps can be purchased at any mining recorder's office
at one shilling each. These charts are of great assistance to mining prospectors. Locators of mining claimsTHE MINING RECORD.

have to blaze boundary lines, erect angle-posts, and
cut L trenches at each corner showing direction of
boundary lines, place legible notices on datum posts
and maintain them until survey is made. Any default
in any of these conditions invalidates the claim The
mining prospector, by virtue of his miner's right and
license, can secure any vacant ground as a " Miner's
Protection Area,'' without recording it whilst prospecting, providing he labours continuously thereon,
but he cannot be absent from his claim, without exemption, tor more than from forty-eight to seventy-two
hours, without danger of forfeiture of his ground by
any person staking it.
These are, briefly speaking, the main conditions of
lode mining throughout Australasia—though the conditions vary somewhat in each colony—and are
generally approved of by both miner and capitalist. I
have seen good claims in this country, that have been
upon any disputes arising out of mining claims—or of
a Council of Mines, consisting of the Minister of
Mines, presidents of the Miners' and Mine Managers
Associations, chairmen of the principal stock exchanges, and representatives of mining companies.
The Council should have the following powers and
duties :—
1. To advise and report to the Minister with respect
to the amendment and codification of existing regulations ;
2. To report to the Minister as to any breaches of
covenants of any mining claims ;
3. To make such proposals to the Minister as may
be advisable for the purpose of stimulating and encouraging mining and aiding it in its development;
4. To generally advise as to any matters whatever
connected with the mining industry of British Columbia.

held for several years—by re-location—without any
work whatever having been done upon them, and
owing to selfish principles involved, I find that it is
not popular to advocate any change in the law on this
point, or in limitation of the immense areas allowed for
mining claims, but it is impossible for such a state of
things to continue, without serious detriment to the
country at large. It is said, that the conditions of this
country are not similar to that of older mining
countries, and that their mining laws are not applicable. . That may be a matter for discussion, and a
practical solution would be found by holding a mining
conference, composed of representatives from every
district, to which the Minister of Mines and the
parliamentary representatives of those districts should
be invited, and discussing the regulations, clause by
clause, and suggesting additions and amendments.
Out of this might grow the constitution of mining
boards in each district, to hear, and if proper, to decide

OMINECA AND ITS POSSIBILITIES.
FROM the numerous enquiries that are being made
by intending gold-seekers and prospectors concerning the Omineca and Skeena River districts, it
may be inferred that this northerly section of the
Province, once before the scene of a gold excitement,
will again, and doubtless during the late spring and
early summer months of the present year, be visited
by hundreds of white men, intent on the search for the
precious metal. Omineca is a district of great mineral
possibilities. Its climate for six months of the year,
that is, from May to October, is delightful ; game is
abundant; the streams are full of fish, and from the
prospector's point of view these are highly apprecia-TtE

conditions. From accounts given by old timers, who
took part in the Omineca gold rush of
'' seventy-two," it is learned that in those days a
great obstacle in the way of travelling in the bush was
presented by the quantities of fallen timber, caused by
the fierce and destructive fires which had raged some
years previous throughout the country. But this is
over thirty years ago, and an old miner who visited
Omineca last year, after a long absence, states that
there is now nothing remaining of those fallen tree
trunks, which have since rotted away, hence travel is
much easier than it was.
The best route to the gold fields of Omineca, is by
way of the Skeena River to Hazleton.    The
THE    Hudson Bay Company have two small 100-
BEST ton steamboats on this river, but the passage
route, can be made easily enough in canoes by experienced boatmen, or Indians can be hired
to navigate the stream for a very moderate remuneration. The river is, however, only dangerous at one
season of the year—during the June freshet—when
the current rushes through some of the canyons at the
rate of from ten to twelve miles an hour. From
Hazleton, at the forks of the Skeena, there is an excellent Government trail for sixty miles to Babine,
the first portage ; from Babine to Tatlah Lake, forty-
five miles, and from Tatlah to Manson, the heart of
the gold-bearing territory, for fifty miles. The old
trail travelled by the miners of the "seventy-two"
rush, was through the " Livepan " Pass, the summit
of which has an altitude of about 9,000 feet, and
meant a tremendous climb, which is now avoided.
The pass was called " Firepan '' b3r the Indians, from
a volcano which though at present extinct, was active
enough fifty years back, and the ground for the space
of nearly four acres in the neighbourhood of the crater,
is still so warm that the snow never lies on it, notwithstanding the altitude.
The Indians in the district are a peaceable and
industrious lot, and many of them are making large
sums of money at mining. One man, "Plug-hat"
Tom, so named from his "swell" head-gear, is said to
have taken out of a claim on Tom Creek, $80,000 in
gold dust, last year.    In the early days an

indians. pel the white man to pay for the privilege
of entering their territory, but the demands
were only made by  the  christianized  tribes  at the
prompting of the priests, and were not acceded to by
the miners.
The  stampede to Omineca really occurred in the
spring of 1872, although some miuing had been carried
on in the district previous to that date.
EARLY       It is  estimated  that  as  many  as  six
DISCOVERIES, thousand men took part in this "rush,"
but the district was by no means thoroughly prospected.    The  largest nugget  found  was
taken from  the discovery claim on Lost Creek, and
was valued at $200,   but  fifty,   sixty, and a hundred
dollar nuggets were not at all uncommon, though gold
the size of wheat grains was more usually met with.
The principal gold bearing creeks were Manson,. Ger-
mansen, Slate, Lost, Black Jack, Tom, and Vital, and
each of these  streams  produced  a  large quantity of
gold.    A claim on Black Jack paid, for instance, $50
per day to the man for some time.    On Slate Creek
two or three miners cleaned up from six to seven
thousand dollars in two seasons; on Germansen a
dozen or so claims yielded from five to six thousand
dollars. Discovery Bar paid over six thousand dollars
to the interest. Robert Howell, the locator of the
first claim on Manson Creek, took out $5,000 worth of
gold in one day; and from a claim called the '' Toboggan, " as a result of six days work the five partners
obtained $1,200 worth of coarse gold each. The gold
from this claim was found on the top of the sand,
which clearly indicated that it had been carried down
in a slide from the hill. The owners of the ground;
however, never succeeded in tracing the direction of
the channel, indeed, no very systematic attempt was
made to do so, and shortly afterwards the men, in
company with the greater number of the miners in the
country, left to join in the rush of '74 to Cassiar. Thus ■
the Omineca gold excitement barely lasted two seasons,
although five years later the country was again visited
by prospectors. In the opinion of old miners, very
few of the claims were located on the original river
bed which, they opine, is a cross-country channel,
intersecting some of the creeks at the spots where the
rich claims were struck. This point may ere long be
cleared up, as all the ground in the vicinity of the
creeks flowing into the Omineca River has been leased
to companies, and extensive preparations for hydraulicing on a large scale are being made.
For those intending to prospect in the Omineca district, this summer, the most promising

prospect.   ity, the "old timer," is the Nation River
section, about twenty-five miles to the
south-east from Manson Creek,    Here some very fair
prospects have been  found,   and  the country is not
difficult of access.
It will be some time, doubtless, before quartz mining
is attempted in Omineca, taking into consideration the
difficulties in the way of transportation, the cost of
supplies and the price of labour. But there
quartz can be no question that the district has great
mining, quartz possibilities. Exceedingly promising
galena reefs have been uncovered, and
specimens of ore brought down eighteen years ago,
assayed $120 in silver. In fact, a Swansea smelting
company offered to purchase the ore at this figure, we
are informed, if brought to Victoria. Then the miners
frequently discovered native silver and copper in the
streams, besides a curiously heavy metal which looked
like "plumbago with a white coating," and which,
very probably, might have been platinum. In short,
Omineca offers fully as great opportunities to the prospector as the Yukon, with a tithe less of the dangers
and hardships that must be encountered in the latter
country.

A  NEW SYSTEM  OF AIR COMPRESSION  BY
THE ACTION OF FALLING WATER.
GREAT interest has been aroused in engineering
and mining circles by the completion of a novel
air compressing plant now in operation at the Dominion
Cotton Mills,  Magog,  Canada,  the invention of Mr.

being installed in the mining
the Kootenai Air Supply Co., which holds a license
for the patent rights of the district, from the Taylor
Air Compressing Co. of Spokane, the latter company
having acquired the rights of the system for British
Columbia and the States of Oregon, Washington,
Idaho and Montana.
The system is simplicity itself. It
utilizes a great principle of nature, namely, that falling water will entrain air and
carry it down, producing its compression
by the weight of the water, no moving
machinery of any kind being required,
and the system being absolutely automatic.
A description of the Ainsworth plant,
now in course of construction, and which
will be completed in August next, cannot
fail to be of interest to mining men, as
the use of the system wherever a water
power is available, is destined to revolutionize the cost of compressed air.
Coffee Creek,  two miles  from  Ainsworth,   upon  which   the  company has
acquired  its   water rights,   is  a rapid
mountain stream with a fall of ten feet
in the one hundred, and a flowage varying from 2,500 to  5,000 cubic feet per
minute.    Here the company is building
a dam across the stream and conducting
the water in a stave barrel flume,  five
feet in diameter,   with the intention of
developing a power having no foot head.
The water from the flume runs into a
receiving tank which stands on a trestle
no feet from the surface of the creek,
and from the center and bottom of which
the down-flow pipe, two feet nine inches
in diameter descends perpendicularly into
a shaft sunk below the level of the creek 210 feet,
the down-flow pipe terminating at the bottom in a
large bell-shaped tank, open at the bottom, so as to
allow the free passage of the water.    The water is
received  in the upper tank, where it rises to the
level of the water in the creek above and flows down
this down-flow pipe, passing over the orifices of a
number of small tubes,  which at their upper ends
are open  to  the air.    In  the rapid  descent of the
water a vacuum is produced, and the  air is drawn
in   through  these   tubes   at considerable velocity,
and   when   once  entrained   in  the water,   is carried down the down-flow pipe to the tank at the
bottom of the shaft.    The capacity of the tank at
the bottom, in the Ainsworth plant,   will be seventeen feet in diameter, and about twenty feet high ;
in the center of the side of the tank is.an indentation
and the water coming  down  the flow-pipe rushes
around this indentation before  finally  falling into
the tank.    The air leaves the water and  rises  to
the top  of the  tank,   the water passing out, and
gradually rising through the shaft outside the down-
flow pipe,   discharging itself into the creek.    The
compression of the air is produced by the weight of
this return column,  every 27^ inches of the return
column producing one pound of air pressure in the
air as it descends in the down-flow pipe.
The air discharge main taps this tank at its highest point, and runs to the drill, hoist or other
machinery. Another pipe, open at the bottom and
discharging at the tail race, extends to the center
line of the tank, and in the event of more air beiner26

made than is used outside, the air passes up
this pipe, and thus
automatically regulates the plant, so
that should all the demands for air suddenly cease, the plant
would still keep running, and the air
made would discharge
itself naturally
through this exhaust.
In the Ainsworth
plant the delivered air
pressure will be 90 lbs.
and this will be carried through a 9-inch
pipe two miles to the
center of distribution
in the Ainsworth
camp. This 9-inch
pipe will carry between 400 and 500
h.p. with a loss of 5
pounds.
The total cost of
plant, exclusive o f
pipe lines, will be in
the neighbourhoood
of $15,000, and $15,-
000 will be required
for pipe lines. The
air will be '' laid on ''
to the various mains
in the district, and
supplied to the customer direct to his drill
at either so much per
cubic foot, or so much
per drill delivered.
The efficiency of
this system  of
water wheel, that is developing more than thirty-five
per cent, of the h.p. efficiency of the water used.
In lecturing on the subject before the McGill College at Montreal, Professor Nicholson showed that in
this system there are two elements of loss, first loss
due to friction and, second, loss due to the rising speed
of the air-bubbles. In the Magog plant the loss due
to friction amounted to seven per cent., while the loss
due to rising speed of bubbles was twelve per cent.,
making a total loss of nineteen per cent. Another loss
in this plant was due to ineffective separation, and in
his lecture he remarks:
'' In future plants this loss will doubtless be avoided,
and we may expect as high an efficiency from this
system as when power is given off a turbine jack-shaft,
when it is not by any means in such a fit state for
transmission as it is in the state of compressed air."
This rising tendency of the bubble is a very interesting problem. The force with which the water
drags the bubble down is always much greater than
the buoyancy of the bubble, so that the bubble always
moves down. In the case of the Magog plant, where
the downward speed of the water was 6.3 feet per
second, the bubble, says Professor Nicholson, " would
have to be 17%! inches in diameter in order to have a
buoyancy equal to the force with which the water
forces it down. The air-bubbles of this plant were, as
a matter of fact, three-eighths inches in diameter at
the top and one-fourth inches in diameter at the bottom of the 143 foot deep down shaft; the speed with
which they moved upward relatively to the' water was
eleven inches per second at the top, and nine inches
per second at the bottom, so that they actually moved
down at the rate of 5.4 feet per second at the top and
5.53 feet per second at the bottom of the down-flow
pipe. The deeper the shaft the smaller the bubbles
become at the bottom, and the more slowly they move
upwards through the water. In other words the
deeper the shaft the less the percentage of loss due to
rising of the bubbles. The bubble absolutely must go
down when once entrained in the water, no matter
how deep the shaft."
air compression is quite remarkable.
In the first plant installed at Magog,
which was very thoroughly tested by
the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Mechanical Department, McGill College, Montreal, an actual efficiency of
62 Yt, per cent, of the hydraulic h.p. of
the water was obtained and delivered
in compressed air, and Professor Nicholson, who made the test, demonstrated that even above this there was
considerable loss due to ineffective
separation of the air on account of the
separator or tank at the bottom being
too small, and he points out that the
centrifugal principle for the air separation which will be used in the Ainsworth plant now being installed, will
increase the efficiency from sixty-two
to seventy-five per cent. In other
words, the system delivers in compressed air as high an efficiency as the
best known turbine can be relied upon
for ordinary power on the jackshaft,
and it is safe to say to-day, that there
is no compressor plant actuated by a
water-blast i or ventilating jumbo mine, rossland.
An old-fashioned method on the same principle as the Taylor System of Air-Compression.THE MINING RECORD.

It will be seen that this compression of air is isothermal, and that the compressed air will always be at
the same temperature as the water, no.matter what
may be the temperature of the free air used. It is
well known that the amount of moisture which is contained in any given quantity of air, depends upon its
temperature and pressure. Its capacity for moisture
varies as the temperature and pressure varies. The
capacity of air for moisture increases with the temperature and decreases as the pressure increases. The
pressure remaining constant, the moisture capacity of air increases with the temperature and vice versa.
In all mechanical compressors up to the present time,
the compression of air is invariably accompanied by a
considerable increase in temperature. The moisture
capacity of the air is raised in the same proportion.
This moisture is absorbed from the surrounding atmosphere and other sources. When the air passes from
the mechanical compressor to the conducting pipes, or
when it'is discharged back to the atmosphere after
performing its work, it reverts to normal temperature
or falls below normal temperature, hence its capacity
for moisture is correspondingly reduced, and. the
moisture which it absorbed during its rise in compression is deposited on the pipes and apparatus, sometimes
freezing up and causing very often serious inconvenience, annoyance and loss of efficiency. In the Taylor
compressor the air is not permitted to rise in temperature during compression, and there being no increase
in temperature, it can absorb no moisture on this
account, and the air passes into the conducting pipes
or other apparatus perfectly dry In fact, in tests
made by Professor C. H. M'Leod, of McGill College,
Montreal, the compressed air was delivered to the
machinery at Magog five times drier than the atmosphere from which the free air was drawn. The isothermal compression is an ideal condition which can
never be reached by mechanical compression.
The system being absolutely automatic, and having
no moving parts, no attendance whatever is required
at the point of compression, and this absence of operating expenses brings long distance transmission of air
forward as a powerful competitor of electricity. On a
ten-miles transmission plant, where the amount of air
required at the end of the line is 1,000 h.p., by starting with an initial pressure of 135 pounds, and dropping to 90 pounds at the terminus, (which represents
a loss of ten per cent.) the delivery can be performed
with a 15-inch pipe, and such a plant can be installed
complete at a cost of not less than $150,000, and when
the plant is once installed, like Tennyson's brook, "it
runs on forever" without attention, except a comparatively small cost of maintaining the pipe lines. Then
again, on a rapid* mountain stream, all the power of
the stream can be utilized by the installation of a
series of compressors, the air from each compressor
being gathered into a common main for distribution.
The Taylor Company is now working out plans for
the installation of an air-plant for the Rossland area,
where the distributing plant will be nine or ten miles
in length. It can be stated that the air h.p. ready for
the drill, at the end of the ten miles, can be delivered
at a cost of $25.00 per horse-power per annum, (after
paying seven per cent upon the capital investment)
or approximately fifty-five cents per diem per drill for
the ordinary 3^ inch drill. The present power cost
for the same drill, where steam is used in West Kootenay, is $5.00 per diem, and electricity, since it has an
operating charge at both ends, and one h.p. of electricity
can produce but half a horse-power of compressed air, cannot reduce this charge more than
twenty or twenty-five per cent.
THE SLOCAN STAR.
THE RESULT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENT WORK.
SINCE the closing down of the Slocan Star last
winter a force of some thirty men have beem employed on development and timbering, work. The
cause leading to the cessation of the mill operations
may be said to have been the lack of development in
the mine, which in its turn was stopped by the impossibility of '' traming '' the rock and timber incidental
to development without interfering too seriously with
the work of supplying the mill with ore.
The management thereupon considered it advisable
to close down the mill entirely at this season ot the
year rather than employ one shift only, on account of
the fact chiefly that steam for power must be used

now, whereas ample water power is obtainable by the
first of June, and such ore as is being broken in the
course of development now proceeding being readily
stored in most conveniently handy old stopes. The
development of the past two months has been of a
most satisfactory nature, not only in the more important matter of placing ore in sight, but also as
demonstrating some features in connection with the
vein's formation not previously known, or perhaps
rather hitherto not properly understood ; for instance,
the " zone " of mineralization has extended to far
greater dimensions than till now supposed. This
mineralization beyond '' supposed footwalls" has
always been most notable in the '' Star.'' General
experience leads miners to expect such phenomenon
to occur mostly on the hanging wall,'but in the Star's
development to date the hanging wall, which is of the
same nature as the footwall (the vein lying in a plane
of fissure cutting the formation obliquely), seems to
have presented a surface comparatively impervious to28

the mineralized circulating liquids at the time ot vein-
filling, as well as a plane separating the shattered ore
from the unshattered country.
Prior to the recent development it had been supposed that 'the vein split into two branches, but now it
is found that those branches reunite, forming a large
horse of country slate, which on the No. 3 level is 110
feet long and 35 feet across in its widest part, and
lengthening in depth at either end of this "horse."
The mineralized body is here larger than elsewhere in
the mine, being in places 30 feet wide and as much as
10 feet of actually solid galena has been mined from
the westerly end. The vein at the east end of this
horse has only recently been opened up, although
previously a drift had been run through on the third
level without, however, the value being demonstrated.
It now appears possible that this portion of the vein
may develop as large an ore body as that at the opposite end of the horse. The development at the Slocan
Star illustrates a most typical exampls of a vein
requiring the closest study and the maximum quantity
of crosscuts.
The management are assured of a long and prosperous mill run upon the resumption of operations at the
Star concentrator.
A curious cave occurred in the Star during the past
winter. Although the mine is comparatively a dry
one, yet a considerable stream of water poured out of
the hanging wall on the third level until a couple of
days prior to the cave. Immediately the cave
occurred this flow made its appearance on the fourth
level 210 feet below, and within fortv-eight hours all
further caving ceased also, so that m many instances
even the timber that had been badly crushed appeared
to retain strength sufficient to resist further pressure.
It would appear that a hydrostatic pressure had been
caused in seams in the hanging wall which before had
no outlet into the workings below the third level.
Under such circumstances no amount of timbering
could withstand such pressure.
LABORATORY    EXPERIMENTS   WITH   THE
CYANIDE PROCESS UPON  DRY ORES
OF SOUTHERN SLOCAN
DISTRICT.
(By W. S.Johnson, B.A., B.A.Sc, Slocan City, B.C.)
NOW that the cyanide treatment of ores has become
a recognized metallurgical process for the profitable extraction of silver and gold from various classes
of ores, not only on this continent, but in Australia
and Africa, where, in the latter country, it has added
so much to the production of gold and the prosperity
of the country, it occurred to me that possibly the
cyanide treatment might be applicable to the dry ores
of this district, and the present paper is the result of
some experiments that have been carried on during
the past winter.
It is not the intention of the writer to enter into a
discussion of the theoretical side of the question, but
to record results obtained from a close attention to a
series of experiments lasting over a period of four
months. This to me seems more relevant to the
furtherance of the practical success of any process of
extraction than the hypothetical discussions indulged
in by many writers in our mining journals. It is
roost probable that those same writers never carried
out any experiments, but no sooner than a paper is
written giving results obtained from actual experiments, are ^ver ready to pull it to pieces.
During the prosecution of this work, literature on
the subject by Alfred James, Prof. Christy, Dr. Schei-
del and A. Van Furman was consulted. To these
gentlemen I wish to express my indebtedness for the
assistance their researches have given me.
The mode of procedure as outlined below is somewhat upon the same lines as that given by H. Van-
Furrnan.* Wherever a departure was made the advantage was first proved before employed.
characteristics  of ore bodies.
The ore bodies of Southern Slocan District may be
divided into three classes :—
I. Galena ;
II. Dry silicious ore bodies containing silver, sulphide (Ay-2 S), and gold, with more or less iron pyrites
(FeS-2);
III. Silicious ore bodies containing gold
I. Galena ore bodies are probably of the same origin as those around Sandon, and as they are smelling
ores, are foreign to this paper, and a more detailed
description is unnecessary.
II. Dry silicious ore bodies containing siver, sulphide (Ay-2 S) and gold, associated with more or less
iron pyrites, zinc blende (Zn Fe) S., etc. This class,
a very important one, extending over a large area,
beginning at Ten-Mile Creek, on east side of Slocan
Lake, and extending in a southerly direction to
Lemon Creek, or that portion of country enclosed by
Ten-Mile and Lemon Creeks, which have their origin
from a common source, and are approximately 200
square miles.*
This class may be again divided into two sub-classes
for cyaniding purposes :—
(a.) Silicious ores in which silver values are predominant ;
(b.) Silicious ores in which gold ores are predominant, or of about equal value.
As sub-class (a.) is rather a smelting ore than one
fitted for cyaniding purposes, I will confine myself to
sub-class (b.)
(b.) This class of ore is chiefly found along 1st and
2nd. North Forks of Lemon Creek and vicinity. As
the main characteristics of this class are similar, a
description of one will apply to all, but it must not be
understood that the same treatment will apply to all,
for each ore body may have physical and chemical
composition differing from that of its neighbour,
although apparently the same to the eye, necessitating a difference in its treatment.
As an illustration of sub-class {b.), the Chapleau
mineral claim, situated on the 1st North Fork of
Lemon, about three miles from "%s junction with
Lemon Creek. This is a silicious ore with silver sulphide, (Ag-2 S) (both in' a fine state decemin-
ated through the quartz and also in crystals) as well
as gold I 20 per cent of the latter is free-milling.
Shipping returns from three car-load lots gave respectively $132, $141, and $85.
Value ratios of gold and siver ores as 4.1.
III. Dry silicious ores containing gold with a little
silver alloyed.    This class of ore bodies to the south •
and head of Lemon Creek, and across the divide into
Ainsworth and Nelson Divisions.

II, and III.
METHOD  OF  PROCEDURE.
As the reliability of experiments of this kind depend
to a great extent upon the method adopted, as well as
the ability of the operator, it seems to me that an outline of the method is in place.
Ores of value of $40 per ton and over, where not
free-milling, are better fitted for smelting or some
other metallurgical process, than cyanide treatment, for this purpose it has been my care to limit
myself to a value of about $40 per ton.
Of the various ores experimented with, a sample of
.ten pounds was taken, when found by an approximate sample to assay about $40. This was crushed
to pass through screens of 10, 20, 30, and 40 meshes
to the linear inch. This pulp was thoroughly mixed
and quartered down to abont 250 grammes. The 250
grammes taken were then crushed to pass through a
screen of 100 meshes to the linear inch. Four half
assay tons of ore taken and assayed separately,, and
the average of the four assays being taken as the
value of the silver and gold per ton.
An analysis from this pulp was made to determine
the different constituents.
One hundred grammes of the 10, 20 and 30 mesh
and taken and percentage of free gold determined.
acidity.
To ascertain the acidity of an ore for cyanide treatment it is important to know the acidity due to soluble
acid salts, and acidity due to insoluble acid salts; the
former of which can be washed out by water, the
latter having to be neutralized by some alkali.
Two portions of 50 grammes were weighed out.
One portion was washed with water and the washed
ore treated with a known amount of deci-normal
sodium hydrate sol. (Na,OH-io), stirred and allowed to stand for twenty minutes. The sodium
solution filtered off into a beaker and ore washed, and
wash water then filtered into same beaker.
The excess of sodium hydrate was determined
by titrating against deci-normal sulphuric acid
(H-2 SO-4/10). This quantity from known quantity
first taken gives the amount of sodium hydrate
required to neutralize acidity of ores due to acid salts
insoluble in water.
The other fifty grammes, treated with a known
quantity of deci-normal sodinm hydrate sol., without
previous washing with water, and excess of sodium
hydrate solution determine as above with (H-2 SO-4/10).
This quantity of Na. OH, subtracted from known
quantity first taken, will give amount of Na. OH
required to neutralize acidity due to soluble and
insoluble acid salts, or the total acidity of ore.
Now data for determining acidity of ore due to soluble acid salts and that due to insoluble acid salts.
Example :—
Let x = quantity of Na. OH required to neutralize
insoluble acid salts ;
Let y = quantity of Na. OH required to neutralize
both soluble and insoluble salts ;
Then y — x = quantity of Na. OH required to
neutralize soluble acid salts.
Having found the quantity of Na. OH required for
acidity of ore ; the equivalent of Na. OH in terms
of lime can easily be calculated by following equation :
Na.'OH : quantity of Na. OH :: Ca. O : required
amouunt of lime.
Example :—
Suppose i5ft>s. Na. OH required to neutralize acidity of a ton of ore; what quantity of lime (Ca O)
would we have to substitute for this ?
Na OH :  15  :: Ca O : required lime ;

40 :  15 :: 56 : lime;
i1, X 56      . ..
Lime = w ii   I 21 lbs. lime.
40
Epuivalent for any other alkaline compound can be
worked out in similar manner.
Some writers* state that when ore is treated with
water and no acid reaction is given with litmus paper,
it may be taken for granted that acid salts are absent.
1 f litmus paper is freshly prepared this may work ;
but it is very unreliable, as I had a case where 25lbs,
of lime per ton was required to neutralize acidity of
ore, still this did not give an acid reaction with litmus
paper.
Having taken all the required preliminary precautions treatment of the ores with cyanide of potassium
was proceeded with.
For this purpose I found, for laboratory work, that
y2 gall Winchester bottles, with the upper portion
cut off, answered very well, the proportions correpond-
ing with size of vats in practical treatment. The
modus operandi was as follows :—
5ln-
Five bottles were placed side by side ; 200 grammes
of ore weighed into each of the first 4, with the requisite amount of Na. O.H. or its equivalent in lime
(Ca.O) 200 cc. of Key. solution added to each, the
strength of which is known, say to begin with 0.1000
per ct. K cy. (Pot. Cyanide).
At end of 24 hours 5 cc. of No. 1 drawn off with a
pipette, and its strength ascertained by titrating, with
standard silver nitrate solution. Then 29.2CC. of clear
solution drawn off with a pipette and placed in a lead
tray, evaporized to dryness on asbestos card. This
lead tray is then rolled up and marked No 1, and put
aside.
At end of 48 hours 5 cc. of No. 2 taken, its strength
ascertained, and 29.2 (equivalent to 1 A.T. of ore) of
its solution evaporated to dryness, rolled up and marked
No. 2, and put away with No. 2.
Also, strength of No. 1 again ascertained, and after
making correction for lesser amount of sol. 29.2 cc,
evaporated to dryness, lead rolled up and marked No.
1a.    This serves as an excellent check on No. 2.
At end of 72 hours No. 3 tested as above, No. 2
this time serving as check.
Finally, at end of 96 hours, No. 4 treated in same
way.

THE MINING RECORD.
After No. 4 has been finished, wash out K. cy. from
ore with water, saving slimes on a filter, dry and when
necessary crush finer, and run through crucible assays;
this will give value of gold and silver left in the ore
after lixiviation with K. cy.
Whilst this is going on the resulting lead buttons
arising from evaporations of 1, 2, 3 and 4 solutions are
cupelled, and gold and silver ascertained. The gold
and silver arising from No. 4 should make up, when
added to gold and silver of No. 4 crucible assay, the
original value of ore. By drawing off clear supernatant liquid, scorification of lead button unnecessary.
Contents of the bottles were stirred every five or six
hours during the leaching.
As 200 grammes of ore were taken and 200 cc. of
solution, 29.2 cc. of solution is equivalent to 1 A.T. of
ore, i.e. the gold and silver found from evaporation of
29.2 cc. (1 A.T.) of solution will equal the amount of
gold and silver extracted from 1 A.T. of ore, or the
number of ozs. per ton extracted.
As there is always more or less acid fumes in a laboratory, it was found necessary to run through a Wank
experiment, i.e. 200 cc. of K. cy. solution, of same
strength as used with ore, were placed in a bottle
alongside of those containing ore, and at the end of
experiment the quantity measurement and its strength
ascertained; quantity measurement to ascertain the
loss of solution by evaporation.
A blank experiment was made in a room free from
acid fumes, and at end of four days the strength of
solution had not apparently altered ; so it was assumed
that any decrease in strength of blank solution run
through with ores was due wholly to acid fumes in
its laboratory, which decomposed the K. cy., forming
H. cy. as :—
2 K. cy. x H-2 S0-4      K-2 S0-4 x 2 H. cy.
SLIMES.
As formation of slimes of various ores during crushing interfere with subsequent lixiviation of ore with
K. cy., No. 2 bottle was washed several times and
wash water decanted through a filter, these slimes
dried and weighed. Amount of slimes per ton can be
estimated from this where crushing of ore in practical
work is same as that employed in laboratory.
The above method I found to work very satisfactorily, and believe that evaporation of solution in lead
tray for laboratory work will give better results than
any method of precipitation.
The precipitation of silver and gold from solutions,
by adding Fe-s for precipitation of silver and zinc
chloride for precipitation of gold, is very unreliable,
as considerable gold comes down with the silver, and
only traces of gold are precipitated with zinc chloride.
Zinc oxy-chloride precipitates nearly all the gold and
should be substited for the chloride when this method
employed.
Prof. Christy's method of precipitating gold from
solutions by acidifying K.C.N, solutions with H2 S0-4,
then adding a cuprous sul., a very neat method, but
for laboratory work, when solutions containing less
than an oz. of gold per ton, I prefer the evaporation of
an assay ton of solution, as in the precipitation of
small quantities of gold from limited quantities of
solutions, there is likely to be an error introduced by
loss in manipulation, filtering, etc.
The above method is rather that of the agitation
process than percolation. The latter process is generally used in practice, the only difference is that
leaching by percolation takes more time to get the
same percentage of extraction.
Having given a general description of the modu$£
operandi employed during these experiments, I will
now give the results in a tabulated form. It will not
be possible to give results of all. experiments, as it
would take up too much time and space ; however,
enough will be given to elucidate the work.
There are four tables in all, I., II., III. and IV.
Experiments of tables I. and II. are upon the same
ore ; III. and IV. upon different ores.

sodium peroxide, the excess of sodium peroxide over
that required for neutralization of acid in ore,  would ,
form sodium hydrate and at the same time evolve
oxygen, which  decomposes  K. cy.   and accelerating
solution of gold, as—

(EUsner's Eq n.)
From the percentage of extraction obtained in (c)
and (d) in comparison with quantity of K cy. consumed, it is probable that too much of an excess of
sodium peroxide was used. The rapid evolution of
oxygen decomposing K cy. more quickly than the
nascent cyanogen could be taken up by the gold to
form the double cyanide (K Au cy-2) potassium auro-
cyanide, hence the surplus cyanogen would form para
cyanogen (cy-2) and as this para cyanogen will not

passes off as a gas, causing useless waste of K C N.

By inspection of table II. it will be seen that percentage of extraction has reached the maximum.
This ore is the same as that used in I., but was
crushed to 30 mesh, and only a slight excess of sodium
peroxide used. This treatment gave better results
than any other tried by the writer, and am of the
opinion that the consumption of K*cy. by careful work
can be further reduced.
It will be noticed that strength of K cy. solutions
exp. (E) was o. 161 perct., and silver and gold extractions were 54 per ct.  and 83 per ct.  respectively,
with consumption of 2 lbs. K cy. per ton ; whilst (F)
whose solution was 0.323 per ct., gave extractions of
68 and 9; per ct., with consumption of 2 lbs. K cy.
per ton. It is therefore evident that the most efficient
strength lies between 0.161 and 0.323 for above ore.
Other experiments were tried upon this ore with
solutions of greater strength, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 perct.
K cy., but the increased percentage of extraction
would not compensate for the additional quantity of
K cy. consumed, which amounted in 1 per ct. solutions
to almost 10 lbs. per ton.

The ore from which results in table III. compiled,
is a better one for cyanide treatment than the above
one, being a somewhat granulor quartz with crystals
of iron pyrites disseminated throughout ore.
COMPOSITION.
Iron pyrites amounted to 2.38 per cent of the whole.
The consumption of cyanide per ton should be even
lower than is shown in the table, as acidity indicated
by litmus paper was practically nothing, after the
exp. had been made I found that there was a latent
acidity not neutralized, this would lower the consumption of K cy. when neutralized.
High extraction of silver no doubt due to the fact
that silver here is alloyed with the gold and not as
Asr-2 S as in former tables.32
THE MINING RECORD.
Again by referring to table IV., the ore used was
pure iron pyrites of low grade, per centage of extraction is very low, when compared with the quantity of
K cy. consumed. The results of experiments as
shown in (J) are best obtained yet. As I am still
experimenting with it, yet may find a strength and
mesh to suit it.

(K Au cy-2 and K Ag cy-2), to run through a series
of boxes charged with zinc shavings. The solutions
are so conducted that they always enter into bottom
of boxes and ascend through zinc shavings. The
gold is precipitated in metallic state and falls to bottom,
whilst some of the zinc goes into solution.
When K cy. solution has passed through the series
of boxes only a small percentage of gold is left in the
solution ; this solution is then pumped back to be
used over again when made up to the required strength.
CUPROUS  METHOD.
Another method elaborated by *Prof. Christy for precipitating gold from solution is by adding cuprous
salts to acidified solutfons, the gold being precipitated
as Cuprous Auro Cyanide (Cu S Au cy-2). As this
method necessitates the destruction of all of the free
K cy. it is only applicable to weak solutions where
the destruction of the K cy. is of no importance.
From laboratory experiments the author says* the
total quantity of gold is recovered, which is not the
case when zinc is used.
His method of procedure is a follows : Solution
with Potassium Auro Cyanide is acidified with H-2 SO-4
then would be added the proper amount of copper
sulphate and common salt, the whole solution stirred
and allowd to stand 12 hours, then filtered. The
residue is called Cuprous Auro Cyanide. This may
be easily refined.
This method of recovery of gold might possibly be
applicable where strong solutions were required, by
following procedure.
In ordinary practice a weak cyanide solution is first
used, followed by a stronger one. Where there* are a
series of vats the strong solution of No. 1 might be
used as weak solutions for 2, 3, 4, etc., ultimately the
solution containing a maximum of K Au cy-2 and
minimum K cy.
This solution could thus be treated by cuprous
method, the destruction of the little K cy. remaining
in the solution being of little moment.
This is a very promising field for further investigation and should be looked into by those intending
erecting cyanide plants.
PROBABLE COST OP TREATMENT.
This is a very important question and as a paper of
this kind would fail in attaining its object unless an
estimate of cost of treatment were appended ; owing
to this I will make an estimate with data I have on
hand.
Owing to the great many factors that enter into a
consideration of this kind one will understand that
such an estimate is only an approximation to accuracy.
To make an accurate estimate of costs, data in above
tables should be supplemented by work on a larger
scale at some place fitted for the purpose. Also quantity of ore "in sight," accessibility of ore deposits,
price of chemicals, freight, labor, etc.', should be
ascertained.
Assuming the laboratory experiments as fairly accurate, (as indeed they should closely duplicate larger
tests when made at a mill), the cost of chemicals can
easily be estimated. For the rest of the data one can
make use of that given by competent authorities upon
similar ores in other places.
The data used in making following estimate was from
tables II. and III.,.and from Dr. Scheidel's Cyanide
Process.
Referring to (F) table II., as being the more satisfactory of the two as regards percentage of extraction,
it will be seen that consumption of K cy. is four lbs.
per ton of ore.
New York quotations upon carload lots of 98 per ct.
K cy. is 28 cts. per lb. Freight, duty and carting to

Consumption of zinc, 8 ozs. per ton, 0.05 ; assuming
lime at mill @ $12.00 per ton, this amounts to 0.006
cts. per lb. So cost of chemicals for such an ore as

COMPARISON OP POTASSIUM CYANIDE PROCESS
WITH SMELTING.
Now let us compare the costs of treating ores of
class (/".) by K cy. with such smelting costs as obtain
here at present from a miner's point of view.
Take a case of a mine upon the 1st or 2nd North
Fork of Eemon Creek :
Cost per ton for packing to railroad at present is
$15, and freight and smelting charges $13.50-^15 per
ton.
Take case of ore (/.) Table II :
Here total value of silver per ton, 38.04 at 56 = $21.28
1.10 at 20 =   22.00
Total value per ton  $43-28
The smelters pay for 95 per cent, of New York quotations of silver, and $19 per oz. for all the gold.
So shipper is paid upon above ore per ton—
i.iooz.  gold at $19 = $20.90
95 per cent. 38.04 oz. silver at .56 = $20.21
Total $41.11
L-ess $15 for   packing,  and   $r4 for
freight and smelting charges. . .. $29.00
Net value of ore per ton... .$12.11
Or ore originally valued at $43.28 nets the shipper
$12.11 by smelting treatment less cost of mining.
Now, same ore by cyanide treatment:—
[See (/.) Table II.]
68 per cent, of total silver value. . . .$21.88 9 $14-47
91      I      "      "      gold     "      ..($22.00)  =    20.20
Total value per ton $34-67
In this case mill would be in the vicinity of mine ;
packing would be reduced at least two-thirds, or to
about $5 per ton. So $34.67 less $5 for packing to
mill, and $5 for treatment, $10 in all, leaves net value
to shipper $24.67 per ton. or a difference of $12.67 Per
ton in favour of the cyanide treatment.
From the fact that there are so many fair prospects
of same general character along 1st and 2nd North
Forks of Lemon Creek and neighbourhood, and that
now it does not pay to ship ore under value of $40 per
ton, so all ore under this value is thrown aside, and
the ratio of ore under $40 is to that over $40 as 5 is to
1 ; so one can readily realize what a boon it would be
to the district if some such cheap method of treatment
of such ores were established in the district.
Before this can be successfully accomplished, careful investigation by laboratory work, supplemented
by experiments upon a large scale, at places fitted for
that purpose, must be carried out, as well as finding
out extent and character of ore bodies. It may happen that an ore may be suited to cyaniding purposes
until the line of " vadose circulation " is passed, and
after that some other process may be required.    Hence
it is necessary to prove the ore bodies to some depth.
When upon this subject, I hope it may not be taken
amiss by saying to capitalists (who have had little experience in such processes as cyanide, chlorination,
etc.) intending investing their money in such processes, is to employ competent men, as there is no
existing metallurgical process that requires such a
close attention to the chemical side of the question in
order to make the method a financial success, as the
difference between success and failure, or at any rate
indifferent results, may be due to very little.
Even practical men in charge of a cyanide mill in
one place could not be expected to inaugurate one
upon apparently the same class of ores in another
place. Once the mill has been placed upon a good
footing the ordinary mill man may manage it ;
and to place a man in charge of the work in its initial
stages who has had neither the practical experience
nor technical training would be suicidal.
Also, when intended investor is satisfied as to quantity of ore visible, and laboratory tests shew it suitable for cyanide treatment, a considerable shipment
should be made (and if possible accompanied by their
chemist) to a mining school of repute, where appliances are designed for all classes of ore.
Sending it to a mill designed and treatment elaborated for a special ore, is of doubtful value, as it
presupposes for the ore sent identical physical and
chemical composition with that class of ore the mill
was designed for, something which will seldom occur,
consequently the results are not conclusive.
It must be borne in mind that treatment and mill
must be designed for the ore, not the ore for the mill,
as above procedure would imply.
In conclusion I wish to say that I have tried to
make this paper as non-technical as possible, consistent with efficiency; and to have made it more so
would have lengthened and rendered it more confusing.
A VISITOR'S IMPRESSIONS OF WEST
KOOTENAY.
(By W. M. Brewer, M.E., late of the Alabama State
Geological Survey).
DURING the recent flying trip,which I made
through the Slocan and West Kootenay districts
I was very strongly impressed with the magnitude of
the superficial area which is known to be mineral-
bearing in the Province of British Columbia. I use
the expression "known to be," although large
portions of the province are to-day comparatively
unexplored, because when the main rivers which
drain the entire territory west of Calgary are to-day
producing placer gold in paying quantities, after having been, many of them, mined for upwards of thirty
years, it is a very safe conclusion to arrive at, that
within the confines of this territory occur the source
from whence all this placer gold has come. The
magnitude is also determined by the fact that nearly
every range of mountains which has received the
attention of prospectors, mineral-bearing ore has
been found, both in paying quantity and grade.
Another feature with regard to the mineral
resources of the province which cannot fail to create a
most profound impression on the mind of a visitor
who gives the question serious thought, is the fact
that such a large area of the province is practically
unknown to any except the Indians. Not only does
this   apply   to  districts remote from railroad trans-34
THE MINING RECORD.
portation, but it is true of localities in the immediate
vicinity of many of the railroad towns, and especially,
also of the richest mining camps
I do not mean by this that around the mineral
camps the ground has not been covered by prospectors,
but that even these prospectors who have staked locations themselves know practically little with regard to
occurrence, extent or permanency of the
ore in the claims they have recorded.
That such a condition exists is the only
weak point in my opinion of the mining
laws of the province, because prior to
recording a claim no definite work, even
to show the " rock in place." is required
of the discoverer. And by this omission the custom has resulted not only of staking and recording
claims without previously having determined the
actual occurrence of ore—"rock in place"—beyond
the finding of a few surface out-croppings or float
which may have been carried for miles, but also of
relocating year after year these same claims through
collusion with friends.
A WEAK
POINT  IN
THE
MINERAL
ACT.
LE BOI COMPRESSOR PLANT, ROSSLAND.
The answer of one prominent mining man to my
criticism on this subject a few days since was :—'' You
see we have so many brokers who are engaged in
floating mining companies and who are perfectly
willing to pay a prospector a few hundred dollars
merely for the acreage of the location, caring nothing
at all whether there is any value attached to it beyond
that By these promoters the prospector is urged to
stake claims and rush through the country from one
district to another with only one aim or ambition
ahead of him; that of recording as many locations
during the year as possible to turn in to the promoter
at the price of one, two or three hundred dollars
apiece."
Of course many locations made in this manner are
eventually developed to a more or less extent, but
usually not until the broker has transferred the
'' location '' to some corporation capitalised at six or
seven figures, the shareholders of which are rarely
local residents. According to the old maxim " All is
well that ends well,'' it would make but very little
difference if all of the  locations were  developed  or
thoroughly exploited, whether the work was done by
prospectors themselves or by corporation, but only a
very small proportion of such locations up to the
present time have received any attention further than
the recording and the relocating.
To remedy such a condition of things is not so easy
but your provincial mineralogist, Mr. Carlyle, has
offered a suggestion which I find mining men in
the country endorse. This is the passage of a law
compelling the performance of a certain amount of
work within ninety days after recording the claim.
Of course it may be urged that a stranger has little
right to criticize the law or regulations under which
the people of the province have lived and prospered
for many years, but in this and the articles to follow
I propose to comply with the request of the editor of
the Record and relate my first impressions of the
mineral producing districts of the province exactly as
they occurred to myself during my travels.
Of course the fact of snow being on the ground in
all of the mining camps south of the Canadian Pacific
Railroad to depths ranging from three to. twelve or
fifteen feet reduced my opportunities of observation to
a minimum so far as the surface indications' were concerned. But through the courtesy of several of the
superintendents of mining companies in the districts I
was enabled to take advantage of other men's experience by seeing several mines which had been developed quite extensively through their underground
workings,—many of them dividend payers.
The policy of paying dividends is cer-
THE        tainly a most praiseworthy one,  but the
premature idea occurs to me that sometimes  the
payment   greed  for dividends is  satisfied  at the
OF expense of the mine, and really eventu-
dividendS. ally to the cost or sorrow of the shareholders themselves. Because when the
ore in sight is mined, and treated from hand to mouth
as it were, instead of development work being carried
ahead, so that at all times there is always blocked out
in the underground workings sufficient ore to guarantee a steady average output for months or even
years to come, some contingency may arise at any
moment through '' faulting '' or some freak of nature
which causes a cessation of shipments, and not only
are dividends then out of the question, but by want of
funds the mine operations themselves stop. It occurs
to me that all the shareholders in British Columbia
companies would in the future be very much better
satisfied if a policy were adopted which compelled the
directors to not only keep at all times a proportion of
the labourers in the mines engaged in prospecting or
development work for future stoping, but also a certain percentage of the earnings in the treasury as
surplus to be used in case of such a contingency as I
have mentioned occurring.
The bounty of Nature in providing the highways
which the waterways   of  the province
nature 's  really constitute, is another feature which
highways, cannot fail to impress the mind of the observant visitor. The system of lakes reaching southerly from the Canadian  Pacific  main line,
has  afforded  a  means  of ingress  and egress to the
Slocan and Kootenay districts,  without which their
development would have been impracticable because
of the enormous investment which would have been
necessary in the construction of railroads.
Although the outside world has heard of the Kootenay mines since their discovery, yet but comparativelyTHE MINING RECORD.

few of the people residing beyond the boundary have
any intelligent idea of the routes by which these mining
districts are reached.    And even those few who know
through information gathered from reports and maps
the best route by which to travel have no conception
of the grandeur and picturesqueness of the trip from
Victoria by the C.P.R.    I doubt if the beauty of the
scenery even can be equalled anywhere
MR.        else in the world.    Of course there are
brewer    many grand and beautiful spots which

Scenery.   sas   River,   in  Colorado,  spots in  the
Yellowstone Park in Wyoming, to say
nothing of scenes in the Alps and mountainous sections in other foreign countries.    But by the route I
have mentioned, one is  travelling  through  scenery
which for the entire distance keeps one's  attention
absorbed.
These mining districts can be now conveniently
leached either from the north or the south, because
from Revelstoke, on the Canadian Pacific, there is
being operated a direct system which connects
the main line with the
various camps, the trip
being made partly by
rail and partly by water.
From the south the
mines can be reached
by railroad from Spokane Falls, in the State
of Washington.
The trip by Canadian
Pacific system is divided as follows: Rail
from Revelstoke to Arrow Head, distance 27
miles down the Columbia River. Here the
head of the lake known
as the Upper Arrow is
reached, and thence to
Nakusp, at the foot of
the lake, the traveller
is transported by steamer. From Nakush to
Sandon, in the heart of the Slocan, the
railway is used; but between Sandon and Nelson
Slocan Take is traversed its entire distance by steamer,
and at Slocan City one again takes to the cars. This
branch of the railway follows for a long distance down
the Slocan River, then crosses a narrow divide to the
Kootenay River, along the south bank of which it
ascends to the southern extremity of the west arm of
the Kootenay Take, which it crosses almost within
the city limits of Nelson. On the return trip it is not
even necessary to travel over the same route, but
instead, the cars are used from Nelson to Robson,
where transfer is made to steamer, and the entire
length of both the Tower and Upper Arrow Lakes, as
well as the portion of the Columbia which connects
them, is traversed, the only portion of the round trip
which is necessarily repeated is that from Nakusp to
Revelstoke. I have volunteered this information for
the sake of the many from the States and elsewhere
who now propose visiting this section.
Before attempting any description of the
the       mines  or mining districts,   I  desire to
kootenay mention the water-power which is being

water     by which it is proposed to generate elec-

Nelson to furnish motive power to run
the machinery and drills, as well as to afford light in
the different mines and smelters.    It is estimated that
2,200 horse-power will be furnished through the canal
now being constructed to carry the water which falls
over  the   precipitous   natural   dam   formed   by   an
immense ledge of rock, and makes one of the grandest
and at the same time most awe-inspiring sights imaginable.     The work of construction is being carried
on as rapidly as possible, and it is expected that the
power plant will be complete in the near future, when
the connection with wire will be made between the
plant and Rossland first, and afterwards, if the service
there is satisfactory, the system will be extended as
desired by  mine  owners  and smelter men.     Some

transmission of electricity from Niagara
Falls has been successfully performed, although
the distance for transmission is, I believe,
hardly so great as in
this case, still there
wordd appear to be little
cause to apprehend
failure. This undertaking is in the hands of
a Rossland syndicate,
and that fact alone is
worthy of remark, because it demonstrates the
enterprising spirit and
energy which prevail
among the leading men
of the camp.
Sandon was the first
mining camp I visited.
Owing to the e x -
treme depth of snow it was impossible to obtain
any information from observation as to the
surface outcroppings here,  but through the courtesy
of Mr. Rathborne, superintendent of the
the queen I Queeen Bess," which is located about
BESS.       four miles   west   of the  town,   I  was
afforded an opportunity to see the underground workings in this mine. The system of working by tunnel, which is almost universally adopted
throughout the Slocan and Kootenay Districts, has
been followed at the Queen Bess. Of the advantages
of mining by this system I will refer to later. The
ore body in the Queen Bess is found usually in the
metamorphosed argillites, but at some points the vein
has cut across the eruptive porphyrites, which as
dykes are intrusions and have cut off the slates. The
trend of the argillites is north-westerly, while the
strike of the vein is north-easterly. Some idea of the
complicated structure can readily be conceived when
these facts are considered, as well as that the ore body
in some places is exposed at the contact between these36
THE MINING RECORD.
different rocks, and at others 15 or 20 feet distant
from the contact and in the eruptive. But with all
this irregularity, which would be very puzzling to a
man not thoroughly acquainted with the formations
in the district, yet the experienced miner finds a certain regularity has been demonstrated when he thoroughly exploits the underground workings. In these
it has been demonstrated that the highest grade ore
and largest pockets are found in the argillites, rather
than in the eruptive rock, which evidently resisted
fracture with a much greater force than in the case of
the slates.
The thickness of the ore body varies from a few
inches to about four feet. At the points where it is
thickest the mineral occurs as solid galena, carrying
silver and lead, or as carbonates. The proportion of
the latter mined up to the present time is probably
25 per cent, of the entire product of the mine.
There shows in the workings a smaller vein parallel
with the main ore body to which I have been referring.
Five drifts at different levels have been run, which
have developed the main ore body to a vertical depth
of about 400 feet, and
two have been run on
the smaller vein. In the
aggregate the length of
the various openings,
including cross-cutting,
is about 3,000 feet. But
comparatively little stop-
ing has been done.
In fact, at the time
of my visit, only one
man was employed at
that work, because no
effort was being made to
ship ore in greater
quantities than sufficient
to meet current expenses. The purpose
of the management is to
thoroughly develop the
mine, and determine the
quantity of ore '' in
sight" and the probable permanency of the
veins.

Mr. Rathborne accepted the superintendency of this
mine after it had been very much '' butchered '' by
his predecessor, and I am satisfied that with the former's intimate knowledge of the district, if he had had
the management from the first opening, a great deal
of money would have been saved which has alread}-
been spent in performing unnecessary work. The
Queen Bess is a property which, to be successfully
opened up, requires to be managed by an engineer
skilled and experienced in the complicated formations
of the district, and it is manifestly foolish for a company owning Slocan claims to engage men unacquainted with the locality to direct operations.
The Queen Bess ore is of such a grade that when
the mine is properly exploited, unless some unexpected contingency arises, this property should rank
among the profitably worked mines of the district.
. Because of the complications in the formation it is
impossible to measure up the ore in sight, even with
the levels opened by the usual method, because development has shown that the squeezes and pockets
CENTttE STAR GULCH,  ROSSLAND
cently   been
occur so irregularly About the only method by which
a reliable estimate can be reached is by checking the
quantity of ore taken from the drifts and figuring the
quantity between the levels on the basis of that taken
from the drift. Even by this method, the result, after
the stopes are worked out, may be found to not agree
with the figures, because it has been already ancer-
tained that the pinches and pockets in the stopes do
not agree with those occurring in the horizontal drift.
At the time of my visit about forty miners were employed on the property.
I unfortunately did not have an opportunity, owing
to the impassable state of the trails, to visit the underground workings in any other mine in this vicinity,
but when due consideration is given to what has been
done in the district, the large sum paid in dividends—
taking into account the difficulties under which the
miners have had to work, because of the lack of good
trails and roads—the fact that there are now no less
than thirty-two shipping mines within this limited
area, one cannot help but be favourably impressed,
and conclude that this portion of the Slocan has a brilliant future before it.
The different systems
of transportation employed for bringing the
ore from the mine to
the point of shipment
make an interesting
study, and demonstrate
the reason why the
mines of British Columbia can be worked to
better advantage during
the winter than during
the summer, notwithstanding the deep snow.
The practice of raw-
hiding ore down a nar
row switchback trail has
been the almost universal
method adopted, but
from now on aerial
tramways will certainly
become very popular.

Bleichart pattern, has re-

spans, the longest being about 800

construct a tramway 9,993 feet in length, which will
ascend the mountain 2,600 feet, and cross the Noble
Five slide at a height of 560 feet, with a span 2,750
long. The method of transportation employed at the
Idaho mine is a gravity tramway built up the
gulch connecting the mine with the concentrator,
the latter being located on a siding of the C.P.R.
When this tramroad was built sheds were constructed
in order to keep the track clear of snow during the
winter. These were supposed to be sufficiently substantial to withstand the weight of a snow slide, but
during the winter of 1896 and 1897, when a slide
occurred, it was found that the strength of the timbers
was quite inadequate.

When it is considered that one horse can easily pull
from one to one and a half tons of ore'properly loaded
in a rawhide, and that the same animal can only pack
about 300 pounds down the trail during the summer,
it may be readily understood why the mines, up to the
present time, have proved more profitable to work
during the winter seasons than at any other time.
I understand that a sufficient sum of money has
been set aside by the Provincial Government for the
construction of waggon roads between the principal
mines and Sandon. This will of course aid very materially in further developing the camp, but I am of
the opinion that the aerial tramways will prove the
most economical method for transporting ore from the
mines, as the workings are all located at a much
higher altitude than the towns.
This, of course, makes it easy to construct these
tramways in a straight line, and the distance is, therefore, very much less than in the case of the waggon
road.

advice not to send out men to conduct negotiations on
the spot who are only capable of drinking champagne.
'' It simply means that those people will be dined to
their heart's content, and "champagned " out of their
senses and their money." Mr. Ogilvie has, in addition
to being interviewed, been lecturing on the gold fields
at Burlington House. He spoke to members of the
London University. His speech was enthusiastically
received. Prophecying the chances in the Klondike
he stated that some will realize fortunes, perhaps a
good many may do so ; on the other hand a great
many, perhaps a very great many, will be disappointed.
But we all know
that much.

hardly realize anything. In February, 1897, two
men worked on what is known as "a lay,"
and realized a hundred thousand dollars for less than
five months' work."
Mr. Ogilvie showed that real development could not
take place until the projected road at Teslin Lake was
constructed, thus lessening the heavy freightage on
machinery. For the agriculturist there was little
opportunity in the region, for there was a frost every
night." It is quite possible that the lecturer may
receive the gold medal of the Royal Society ere he
returns to Canada, the birthplace of the metal.
Mr. F. M. Stevens, who has lived one year longer
in the Klondike than the above speaker, has come to
London for the first time, and says that young men
who have strong constitutions, with grit and nerve,
could find no grander opening than to prospect in the
Klondike, but with the chance of returning after five
years without success. For all that, the region will
yield millions of dollars, and when the hydraulicing38

plants are fixed Klondike will supply the world with
all the gold she wants, and a trifle more. At the same
time expensive mining plants are not wanted.
With regard to companies new and old there is a
fair amount to be said. With respect to the amalgamation of the London & Globe Company the Westminster Gazette expresses itself pretty frankly when it
remarks that the shareholders-find themselves between
the devil of reconstruction and the deep sea of amalgamation. They are choosing the latter, probably to be
buffeted about in the waves like a ship
company without a rudder. The amalgamation is
MATTERS, only for the benefit of the companies,
inasmuch as it is one way of staving off
reconstruction. More capital, however, has to be
found somehow to go on with, and unless the shareholders seize a favorabie opportunity to get out they
may find their last state worse than their first. This
is hardly a pleasing prospect for a company which has
some stake in the Yukon region. Apparently the

Managing Director of the L. & G., " and be prepared
in any colony to take up the best business offering. It
will represent a combination of valuable interests
rather than an interest in one solitary mine, which
may or may not fulfil expectations.'' Apropos of the
B.A.C. some grumbling is heard on the ground that
though the application shares were forwarded in
December the allotments had not been made three
months later, which is scarcely a businesslike
ceeding.
Mr. Stevens alluded above to the possibilities of
hydraulicing in the Yukon. The Klondike Hydraulic
Company have forestalled him, and stated to their
shareholders that the vendor was taking the whole of
his consideration in ordinary shares, with the exception of promotion fees. No dividend was to be paid
on the ordinary shares until the preference holders had
received back the whole of their capital in the shape.
of dividend, and no ordinary shares were to be issued
until the large quantity of gold, said to be in possession of the vendor at the mine, was handed over to the
company. The chairman of the company, Mr.
Williams, had gone to Klondike to see that everything was carried out properly. They hoped to get at
least one month's working before the season closed.
At an extraordinary meeting of the Yukon Gold-
fields the Board declared their intention of calling up
further capital. Hitherto they had only asked for
five shillings per share because they were anxious,
when so little was known of the Klondike and its
auriferous deposits, to limit their liability to the
smallest possible amount compatible with the risks
which must always be expected in such an enterprise.

Chronicle carefully reminds us, companies which work

for there is no guarantee that chemical science will not
discover a process to-morrow as superior to the present
one as this process is apparently to those which have
gone before. The Lake Bennett & Klondike Steam

pretensions, being satisfied with a capital of £\ 50,000r

which is ample enough for the purpose. It intends to
run steamers from the head of Lake Bennett through
Marsh Lake and the Upper Yukon River to Dawson
City, the monopoly for which route during the ensuing
season has been practically secured by this companv.
They expect to carry at least four-fifths, of course of
the hundred thousand passengers bound for the golden
district. Other companies are the Canadian Goldfields
with a capital of .£150,000, the Klondike, Cassiar
Miners & Traders with a small account of £25 000.
This latter, however, proposes to deal in mortgages,
charges, patent rights, etc., also as hotel and tavern
keepers, brewers and corn merchants—a somewhat
strange combination, but calculated to secure the
miner's money both when he is prosperous and bankrupt. The British East Kootenay Syndicate with a
capital of .£10,000 has much the same end in view.
NUMMUS.
FROM FAIRVIEW.
THE return of spring
and pleasant
weather has also
ushered into Fair-
view the promise of,
if not a "boom," at
least a decided activity in mining matters. Kruger Mountain, about twelve
miles south of Fair-
view, seems to be
attracting the attention of investors to
its—according to surface indications—vast
bodies of gold and
copper ore. I understand that Capt. Duncan, of the Duncan
Mines Co., is expected
shortly, to direct the
development of his
Company's claims on
Kruger Mountain and
here.
Owing to the delay
in shipment of some
detail of the mill
machinery, the Joe
Dandy mill has not
yet commenced work,
but by the 1st of May
it is expected that
work will  be in  full
swing, and in my next 30-foot quartz vein of the
I hope to give a favourable report of the first clean-up.
On the Joe Dandy mine a good deal of stoping is being
done to expose an inclined ledge which is shortly to
be subjected to a mill test. The ore appears to be
very rich, carrying galena, and, in places, large specks
of gold are to be seen.
A tram line has just been surveyed from the mouth
of the Smuggler tunnel to the mill-site on Okanagan
River ; the distance is about two and one-half miles,
and the fall 1,000 feet. I hear that the B.C. Lumber
Company is to get out the lumber necessary for construction works, at once. In the Smuggler mine the
upraise is still being continued, and on the tunnel
level two drifts are being run in opposite directions
along the ledge, which still shows up well.
A new strike Of considerable value is reported on
the Tinhorn, but at present only a few miners are
employed there, as the management is waiting the
arrival of a compressor plant before proceeding further
with the old workings.
The plant for the Stem winder has now arrived, and
will be put in place with the least possible delay. It
is said that the tramway to the Tinhorn mill is to be
commenced shortly.
There are many claims with big surface showings
in this camp, and of these the Orofino and Independence  (Orofino Mines,  Ltd.) are by no
A means to be overlooked.    These claims
promising lie on the summit of the divide between
mine.      Fairview  and   Keremeos,   and  contain
ledges from three and one-half to fifteen
feet wide, and carry values in gold of from $1.60 to
$804.00 per ton ;   average samples from shafts and
tunnels yielding a s
much as $90.00 per
ton. On this property
about two hundred
feet of tunneling and
sinking has been
done, besides i n -
numerable open cuttings and stripping.
The ledge is of red
and white quartz, of
free milling character,
shewing well in
galena and iron
pyrites. The Orofino
Ltd. is of Vancouver
birth, and is not yet
a year old. The
local manager is Mr.
F. Robinson, and
great credit is due
him for the way in
which he has shewn
up the property in so
short a time.
A case of ore salting occurred here the
other, day, and resulted in the sale and
purchase of what may
yet prove a good
claim. It happened
thus : Two free but
not independent
miners, possessing an
everlasting thirst and

a very large and handsome looking ledge
of yellowish quartz, approached a local capitalist,
intent on making a deal. After a good
deal of bargaining the price was agreed upon,
and the deal concluded, subject to the condition that
the sellers were to pan the samples selected by the
capitalist, and produce colours—which they were sure
they could do. The quartz was then crushed and
panned, and sure enough, there were colours as large
as pinheads, so the money was paid and both parties
were jubilant until next morning, when the capitalist
tried to pan out some more colours, without success,
and then looking over his samples, found some small
pieces of unmistakable "Smuggler"  ore, taken from40

the richest pay-streak of that mine, and this explained
the affair.
We are at last to have direct wagon road communication with Keremeos, and about the middle of May
construction work will commence, and be pushed as
vigorously as Mr. C knows how. In the Keremeos and Similkameen valleys, there are a great
number of mineral claims located, and many of these
are being thoroughly prospected. In many places
large surface deposits of hornblend, carrying a large
percentage of native copper, have been discovered,
and there seems to be a bright future before this camp.
A townsite has been laid out near the junction of the
two valleys, and already we hear of stores and dwelling houses that are to be erected there.
RICARDO.
FROM NELSON.
MR. KELLIE'S "Truck Act," is meeting with great
opposition in this country. There is, of course,
no question that the system has been abused, and
labourers of different kinds have met with much hardship under it, but to condemn good and bad alike in
one sweeping
measure,
hardly seems
to be a good
policy. The
boarding
houses a t-
tached to the
v a r i o u s
mines, are as
a rule, well
run, the men
being provided with
ample food
and lodging
for about five
or six dollars
a week, a
small sum out
of their earnings, which
run from fifteen to twenty. Large
concerns like
the Hall
Mines know
that it is to
their benefit
to make their
men comfortable, and their boarding
are excellently managed. Most of the mines
are in inaccessible places, and if the owners are
prevented from running a boarding house, the business
will fall into "the hands of contractors, whose only
ambition will be to squeeze the last dollar out of the
men's pockets.

their adversary the usual courtesies of debate, but reply
solely with abuse and ridicule. However, the Govern^

if it does what is to become of the surplus product
after Canada has taken all she can use. The advocates
of a duty talk glibly of a Chinese market, and other
outlets in Asia ; but they will find that to divert the
course of trade and obtain a dumping-ground for its
products, is not quite such an easy task.

The Slocan Star is at work again, and so is the
Dardanelles, whence a fine strike of rich ore is reported. The Athabasca, just above Nelson, has,_ it is
stated, passed into the hands of an English syndicate.
There are four claims in the property, with three distinct leads. Some of the ore has been reduced at the
Hall  Mines smelter,   with  results   of about  $80   a
ton. It works
very well
with the Silver King ore.

THE MONTH'S MINING—A SUMMARY.
ALBERNI.
Nothing of particular interest has been heard from this district during the month, with the regettable exception, perhaps,
that the negotiations for the sale of the Alberni Consolidated
failed to materialize. It is understood, however, that another
deal is in progress for the bonding of this undoubtedly prom-THE MINING RECORD.

ismg property. The B. C. Gold Trust, Ltd., is steadily developing the Oronoca and other claims at Uchucklessit Harbour,
and under the direction of Mr. Thos. Bateman, M.E., more
satisfactory work is being done.
SHOAL BAY.
(From Our Special Correspondent.) "
About one mile and a half from the shore of Fanny Bay,
on the west side of Phillips Arm and on the south side
of the Bay, is situated the Dorothy Morton, which was
bonded last fall by Mr. J. J. Lang for $20,000. Work was then
commenced, and considerably over 500 feet of tunnelling has
been done in two places, which crosscut a lead of 106 feet of
quartz, in which there is a pay streak 8 feet wide heavily
mineralized with pyrites, and said to assay $40. Assays of
from $2 to $92 have been got from various parts of the lead,
and it is probable that the average worth will be at least $10,
the whole of the value being in gold. A limited company has
nowbeen registered as the Fairfield Exploration Syndicate,
owning the Dorothy Morton and nine other claims adjoining.
They are now establishing a large camp for the accommodation of employees on the shore of Fanny Bay, preparatory to
putting in an aerial tram from the mine down to the water
front. The timber is being cut away for 200 feet along the
proposed tram line, which will be installed as soon as this
work is completed. The company, moreover, propose to
install two power drills at once, and to build a cyanide reduction plant on the water front. Coal will be brought on scows
from Nanaimo, and the water in the bay, which is nearly
fresh, will be used. Some of the gold in this mine is said to be
free and the results and the method of treatment to be employed
by this company will be watched with great interest. The
concern is capitalized at ^"50,000 in £i shares. I hear that
the Company have purchased the Dunn block and other real
estate in Vancouver, but if their mining operations here prove
successful the future of the district will be assured, and with the
profitable working of the Blue Bells, the Champion and the
Dorothy Morton, Shoal Bay will consequently attract great
attention. There are many other prospects which should be as
good as these when developed. The main tunnel on the Blue.
Bells is being driven further in and another large ore body of
phyrrhotite was reached last week. The owners of the
Champion seem well satisfied with their prospects and work
on this mine is being rapidly prosecuted. Mr. John Cobeldick
is now at work on his claims in Estero Basin and some sixty
feet of tunneling cross-cutting the lead has been done. Some
very fine looking specimens have been brought down. The
tunnels are in quartz for the entire distance. The big wheel
installed by Col. Forsyth is now in running order, but rock
work has not yet been started, the intention being to use power
drills from the begining of operations. The owners of the Ajax
have completed $1,600 worth of work on this property including sixty feet of tunneling and considerable open cutting. They
have some hundreds of dollars worth of grey copper ore on the
dump and in sacks, the ore assaying in the neighbourhood of
$100. The face of the tunnel is in a fine showing of bornite
which carries a good proportion of precious metals with the
copper.
FIRE MOUNTAIN AND HARRISON LAKE.
Very gratifying accounts have been received of the progress
of mining in this district. The properties of the Fire Mountain Gold Company are being thoroughly exploited and
developed, the Money Spinner lode having now been opened
, up by a 231-foot tunnel, a 96-foot winze, and an upraise of 55
feet. This is the most developed prospect in the district, but
there are many claims which promise equally well. Prospectors are now going in by the Harrison route to a new field
beyond, as far as the Lillooet River, which has hitherto been
practically unexplored.
LILLOOET.
Good reports continue to be sent in from the superintendent
of the Golden Cache, and seemingly the nickname this mine
received of the " Golden Catch " will shortly be proved inappropriate. The main tunnel is in now over 175 feet, and the
pay streak, which is reported to be two feet wide, assays from
$3 to $211 in gold. The company are installing a large electric
plant and other machinery. A dam is being built, and the
flume chamber and power house will be completed in June.
Meanwhile the season is somewhat backward in the district,
and the trails are in very bad condition. Prospecting, however, will fairly commence by the first week in May, and a
very active summer is anticipated. On the Forty Thieves
group, the Blackbird, Mineral King, Ben D'Or and other
Bridge River claims development work is being prosecuted.
CARIBOO.
The season in Cariboo has fairly commenced. Work has
been started on the Horsefly, Cariboo Consolidated, Maud and
other large properties. A company has been formed to dredge
on the Quesnelle River, and the machinery was shipped this
month. The company hope to derive much benefit from the
damming back of the river by the Golden Quesnelle Company.
Ashcroft, the starting point for Cariboo, is now very crowded
with parties of prospectors and gold-seekers who propose
travelling by this route Yukonwards. At present, however,
the road is not in a particularly good state, the season being
somewhat later than usual.
KAMLOOPS.
(From our special correspondent.)
Work on the Noonday is being vigorously carried on. There
is an 18-inch ledge of quartz carrying visible free gold. Further development is awaited.
The Iron Mask is still tied up.
Now that the Iron Cap is bonded, pot-hunters are scrambling
for bonds on surrounding claims.
The Pothook-Bonanza group is showing up well. The ledge
of high grade copper ore encountered while cross-cutting
shows there is more in this claim than a certain expert
imagined. New claims are being staked out daily, and claim
holders continue pegging away at assessment work.
BIG BEND,  ILLECILLEWAET   AND TROUT LAKE.
The announcement is made—but of its truth we are unable
to vouch—that the British-America Corporation contemplate
acquiring copper properties in Illecillewaet. It is, nevertheless, certain that this district is beginning to attract much
attention, and a number of mining claims are now being
developed with excellent results. Among others, the Donald,
whereon a large body of low grade ore is being opened up with
a tunnel, which is to connect with an 80-foot shaft already
sunk, promises well.
Placer ground on French Creek, in Big Bend, is being taken
up, and the several companies owning properties here are
installing machinery and otherwise preparing for active work.
In the Trout Lake district extensive development operations
are being carried on at the Silver Cup, owned by the Sunshine,
Limited, a subsidiary company of the Lillooet, Fraser River &
Cariboo Gold Fields, Ltd. A depth of nearly 250 feet has been
reached in this mine, and a large body of high grade ore has
been shown up. A shipment of 250 tons of ore was made this
month. On the Free Coinage, a ledge of 14 inches of high
grade ore was recently struck, and equally good reports have
been received from the Carbonate Chief, on Keystone Mountain, the Union Jack, Ottawa, on Lardeau Creek, Mountain
and Blue Jay, on Silver Tip Creek.
VERNON.
In the Vernon district the principal matter of interest is the
proposed amalgamation of the Morning Glory and Ruby Gold
Mining companies. The Morning Glory has from all accounts
been in a somewhat bad way of late, a telegraphic despatch
announcing that a part of the machinery had been sold by the
sheriff to satisfy judgments amounting to $270. On the Moffat
Creek Gold Mining Company's hydraulic claim, situated upon
Moffat Creek, a small tributary of the Salmon River, which
empties into Shuswap Lake, a prospecting tunnel is being
driven. Should the work being done at present prove satisfactory, and demonstrate that the gravel deposits are sufficiently rich in alluvial gold, it is said the company will then
commence the construction of a large flume for the conveyance
of water over a distance of about ten miles, the water to be
used for hydraulic and ground sluice purposes. Seven men are
now at work on the property, but under the changed condition
indicated this number would be greatly augmented.
THE SIMILKAMEEN.
For some time past quartz mining has been in progress on
Tulameen River claims, in the Similkameen, and several
excellent prospects have been found here. The Crown Point
has four veins of galena and copper pyrites from one and one-
half to four feet in width, and assaying $20. The Gold Coin,
developed by an open cut which crossed two veins, assayed
from $6 to $22 in gold. The Bonanza Queen, which adjoins it,
has a tunnel of 50 feet showing a vein of from three to six
feet, from which assays from $20 to $210 have been obtained.
The Nevada, adjoining it on the north, has the same indications. The Copper Ring, about a mile away, has a vein carrying gold and copper assaying from $30 to $40. Farther to the
westward are several claims which are showing up well.42
THE MINING RECORD.
BOUNDARY CREEK.
On several of the better known and more developed properties in the Boundary Creek district, work is now proceeding,
and particularly favourable reports have been received from
the Golden Crown and Winnipeg claims, in Wellington Camp.
On the Winnipeg, a lead, thought to be an entirely different
one from the two already known to cross the claim, was encountered in an open cut run near the line separating the
Winnipeg from the Golden Crown. The width of the ore" vein
met with in this open cut has not yet been definitely determined, but it has already been shown that there is a large
body of ore, chiefly solid pyrhotite, an assay from which went
over $50 in gold. The occurrence of a big deposit of ore,
returning so comparatively high an assay value close to the
surface, is regarded as of much importance. It is stated that
ore from this new find can be shipped at once, and that
consequent upon this valuable discovery the Winnipeg Company's stock has been withdrawn from sale. On the Golden
Crown a tunnel, cutting the six leads, has been driven for over
■ 300 feet. Work is now being centered in sinking a main shaft
which is already down to some depth. The Golden Crown is
rightly considered one of the most promising properties in the
camp. On the Old Ironsides operations have been temporarily
suspended, owing to some mishap with the pumping appliance. A new pump has however been ordered, and work will
shortly resume. The Snowshoe, in Greenwood Camp, is showing up well under development, and work will shortly be
again started on the Sunset, in Deadwood Camp, the Last
Chance, in Sky Lark, and other properties. Prospecting will
be largely confined, this season, to the West Fork and the
main Kettle River on the west side of Boundary Mountain, and
to the Christina Lake section on the East.
ROSSLAND.
To the operations of the B.A.C. in the Rossland camp, the
present activity in this district is largely ascribable, and the
increased demand for Rossland stock during the past month
has been marked. Work on the principal properties acquired
by this Company by Mr. Macintosh, is to be commenced at
once, and if the ore bodies are there itmay be taken for granted
that under the official direction of Mr. Carlyle and his colleagues, the Columbia & Kootenay, the Josie, Nickel Plate
and Great Western, will ere long be placed on a shipping and
dividend-paying basis. The property of the Iron Colt Gold
Mining Company, Limited, which consists of the Iron Colt
mine, situated on Columbia and Kootenay mountain, has been
optioned to an English syndicate. The terms of the option
are private, but it is said to be about $100,000.
The War Eagle threatens to even rival Le Roi in the near
future, so satisfactory is the present showing of ore in sight.
This, according to the Rossland Miner, has trebled in the last
six months, and the visible supply of ore is now perhaps rather
sanguinely estimated as valuing in the neighbourhood of three
and a half million dollars. The mine has been opened to a
depth of 625 feet. Rich strikes are reported to have been made
on the Jumbo andiron Mask, and operations are proceeding
steadily on the Sunset No 2, the Deer Park, the Victory,
Triumph, the Big Four, the Velvet, the Evening Star, and
other properties. Important changes are taking place at the
Trail Smelter, the old reverberatory matter furnaces being
removed, to be replaced by new blast, with double the original
capacity of 250 tons. Shipments are being made to the smelter
from the War Eagle, but the furnaces will probably not be
blown in before the 1st of July.
The Ymir, Dundee, Tamarac and Porto Reco all have ore
on the dump ready for shipment. Several properties have been
sold at good prices to English and American companies during
the month.
NELSON.
The most important happening at Nelson for April is, doubtless, the sale of the Athabasca to a strong English Company
for the relatively large sum of $750,000. The new owners propose setting aside $100,000 to equip the mine with a plant which
will consist of a compressor and stamp mill, besides the necessary pumps and hoist. The Athabasca was taken over by a
joint stock company in 1896, and for almost a year a force of
from twenty-five to thirty men have been employed. Ore
taken and shipped out then paid running expenses, and about
600 tons is on the dump, ready to be crushed. Two shipments
of 60 tons averaged $107 to the ton. About 30 tons of ore are
being daily crushed at the Fern, and the mine is on a most
satisfactory basis. The installation of automatic sizers has
been accomplished.
Ainsworth.
Some promising finds have been made near the new town of
Kuskonook, on Kootenay Lake, and the Last Chance in the
same neighbourhood is now shipping ore of fair value. The
Black Diamond at Ainsworth is shipping regularly, and the
No. 1 Mine has commenced shipments to the Hall Mines
smelter.
WHITEWATER.
A correspondent writing from Whitewater reports the strike
often inches of clean galena—which has since widened to
eighteen inches—at a depth of 1,000 feet on the Whitewater
Deep.    The importance of this strike cannot be overestimated.
SLOCAN.
While business is generally in a somewhat depressed state at
present in the Slocan, this is not due to mining inactivity, and
shipments continue to be made from the principal mines. At
the Noble Five operations have again been resumed, and the
Slocan Star will again shortly ship heavily. It is stated that a
large body of clean ore was recently struck in the lower tunnel
of the Payne.
On the Dardanelles, a drift on the seventh level, at a depth
of 340 feet, cut the ore chute last week and encountered a good
body of ore. The ore is high grade, and contains less zinc
than in the drift above, or at any other point in the mine.
The lead is fully four feet in width, with good walls. The
company is taking out an average of one car per week. Work
is in progress on the Adams group, the Conductor, and other
promising properties near Sandon. Encouraging reports continue to be made from Slocan Lake mines. On the Comstock,
on Four-Mile Creek, a concentrator is to be erected. Two
thousand feet of development work has been done on this
property and a high-grade body of galena, running as high as
from 100 to 300 ounces in silver, and from 60 to 80 per cent, in
lead has been exposed. Claims on Fidelity Mountain, near
Silverton. are also turning out well. The Enterprise, on Ten-
Mile Creek, is working a force of fifty men, and 1,000 tons of
high-grade ore has been carried down to the Lake for shipment. On Lemon Creek the Southern Chief is being opened
up, and a shipment may be shortly expected. The Evening
Star is also being worked, and the Bank of England has been
leased for one year. A ten-stamp mill is being installed on
the property of the British Canadian Gold Fields Exploration,
Development & Investment Company, on Lemon Creek.
This camp is beginning to attract a great deal of attention,
and the fact has already been established beyond question
that many of its mines are extraordinarily rich. The population has lately increased to 1,000, and the pay roll now exceeds
$20,000 a month. Another encouraging sign is the large
amount of machinery that is being installed at the several
mines, notably a 50-ton concentrator at the Dundee, a large
stamp at the Ymir, and hoisting machinery and a 50-ton concentrator at the Tamarac, and a concentrator is to be erected
on the Porto Rico. The Dumas is at the head of the north
fork of Wild Horse Creek, and has a tunnel of 100 feet, which
has been run on the ledge from the start. There are from
three to five feet of quartz containing zinc, galena and iron.
Four average assays gave 20 ounces of silver, 32 per cent, lead
and $40 in gold. Work of crosscutting has been commenced,
showing the hanging wall to be in quartz and ledge matter.
At present there are several tons of ore on the dump. Near
the Dumas is the Elise, on which there are two shifts
employed, and it is expected to tap the lead after running 100
feet more. On the Summit property, on the north fork of the
Wild Horse, a crosscut tunnel of 175 feet is being run.
MINING IN NORTH-EAST   KOOTENAY.
(From our special correspondent.)
The prospects of this district have never been better than
they are at the present time. Already prospectors from West
Kootenay are coming into the district, the successful results of
last season's work having demonstrated that this section of
British Columbia possesses as good mineral resources as any
other. A new feature of the situation, too, is the large
number of men from Washington, Idaho and Montana, who
are coming into the district. This is due to the fact of the
Klondike rush, and hundreds of prospectors are crossing the
boundary into British Columbia from the neighbouring states.
The Kootenay, Columbia, Fraser, Parsnip and Findlay rivers
form an almost unbroken line of water communication from the
United States to the far north, and this remarkable valley of
800 miles in length has been referred to by Sir William
Dawson, Sir Sandford Fleming and Mr. Moberley as affording
a wonderfully easy route into the eastern portions of the
province. This route to the north has also the great advantage that prospectors will be passing through  a practically
■ JUU..l,.l'JJJ..J^jRii*UIEJi.AJ^.THE MINING RECORD.
43
unopened country for most of the distance, but one which has
already shown great promise of being rich in mineral Game
is plentiful and feed for pack animals abundant. Hay can
therefore, be cut and stored to provide fodder for horses dur^
ing winter months. The government are assisting the opening of this great interior highway by re-building the Moberly
trail from Donald to Canoe River. Thence it is open prairie
country, and easy to travel. It is likely that there will be a
great rush of prospectors through this country as soon as the
snow goes and the country is accessible by the completion of
the trail referred to.
There appear to be excellent placer prospects in this northern country, as a party leaving Golden recently for Cummins
Creek (which flows out of the Rockies about sixty miles beyond
Donald) report having found gold in all the prospect holes
which they sunk, twelve in number, but owing to the quantity
of water, the party, not having the means to contend with this
■ difficulty, abandoned the work for the time being. The existence of gold, however, in paying quantities in this locality
was sufficiently demonstrated. The limestone of the Rockies
here changes to slate, and numerous quartz veins crossing the
country are traceable, although there lias been little oros-
pecting.
Actual mining operations also promise to be brisk this
season. The coming mine of the district is undoubtedly the
Bennison. and it has been so highly developed that regular
ore shipments will certainly follow as soon as communication is established with the outside. While the owners of
this mine were prepared to contribute handsomely they do not
see their way to assuming the entire cost of the road up the
Beaver Valley, seeing that this road will be so much a work of
general public benefit, opening up several mines as prospective
shippers. The importance of having a good shipping mine in
this part of the country cannot be over-estimated, and it would
be a thousand pities if such a promising property as the Bennison should lie idle for want of some reasonable consideration
on the part of the Provincial Government.
It is stated that the Vancouver Finance and Development
Company propose to put a diamond drill on their copper properties at Jubilee Mountain. Mr. Henry Croft of Victoria, is
also heavily interested here. The development work so far
has revealed marvellously rich specimens of copper, but the
results have not yet been satisfactory from a permanent mining point of view, and the only effective means of prospecting
these deposits is undoubtedly by means of the diamond drill.
Development work will also be steadily prosecuted in the
Bluewater and Ottertail districts.
It is encouraging to see investors paying more attention to
this district, a syndicate having purchasedthe Burns mine, on
the Middle Fork of the Spillimachene. There is a five-stamp
mill on this property, and the new, owners propose to operate
the mine during the present season, but it will be necessary to
put in a cyanide plant to save the gold more effectually than
was done when the mill was operated on a former occasion.
The large copper deposits on Horsethief Creek will be
developed this season by Mr. Rutherford, of Vancouver, and
the English Company represented by W. G. Mitchell-Innes.
The galena deposits on Toby Creek a*re about to be opened up
by the British Pacific Company of Victoria. It is also stated
that a Scotch company has been formed to work the big galena
deposits on the Bugaboo. The Bald Mountain Company propose to work their property this season, or dispose of it to a
Development Company which has offered to take it under a
working bond.
A new assaying institution has been established at Calgary
under the management of Mr. W. C. Howard, who possesses
high English and German qualifications.
The North-East Kootenay Miners' Association has been
very active since its formation in November last. The meetings are held monthly, and great interest has been taken in ■
the proceedings, which have so far mainly been confined to
the consideration of desirable amendments of the Mineral
Act, and suggestions to the Government Agent as to the most
necessary trail works.
The indefatigible Mining Recorder at Golden, Mr. F. C .
Lang, is not satisfied with the already fine collection of the
ores of the district that he has made for exhibition at the
Government Office, but he has obtained authority to erect
enlarged show cases, and he is increasing the collection in
such a way that without going out of the town of Golden the
visitor can obtain a first-class idea as to the different ores of
the district, and its resources as a whole.
The ores of the north-east Kootenay are mainly of _ the
yellow metals, which are most in demand, at the present time,
gold and copper, and this probaly accounts for the keener and
more accive demand for properties that has been experienced
here of late.
FORT STEELE DISTRICT.
Persistent rumours are afloat to the effect that an English
syndicate desires to secure the famous East Kootenay mine,
the North Star. Whether there is any truth in these reports
or not, it is certain that capital, both English and American,
is being invested heavily in East Kootenay at the present
time. Recently a group of eleven claims, on Magic Lake, and
forming a part of what is known as the St. Eugene Group,
were sold to a Chicago syndicate for a considerable consideration, and extensive operations will be commenced to develop
the properties. Placer mining is also likely to become an
important industry in this district. On Wild Horse Creek the
Invicta Gold Mining Company, the Nip & Tuck company, the
International Placer Mining Company, Brewery Creek Placer
Company, Jennings & Poison Company, McMillan & Co., and
three Chinese companies are actively engaged.
About 90 locations have been made on the North Fork of
St. Mary's River. The ore carries gold, silver and copper, and
the ore belt is well defined.
On Mark Creek, in the silver lead belt of the Selkirks, are
the North Star group of 22 claims and 80 other locations on
the south side, and on the north the Sullivan group and about
80 other locatious, making 160 altogether. The ore is fine
grained galena assaying from 40 to 60 oz. in silver and from 50
to 65 per cent. lead.
PUBLICATIONS.
CANADA'S METALS, by Prof. Roberts-Austin, ( London ;
, Macmillan & Co., 1898, 8vo, Pp. 46, (Price, 2s. 6d.) The
publication of a volume on this subject by so eminent an
authority-as Prof. Roberts-Austin, is in itself somewhat of a
tribute to the prominence that is now being given to Canadian
mining affairs. The book will undoubtedly assist in drawing
attention to the great mineral possibilities of Canada in general,, and British Columbia in particular.

THE LEGIBILITY OF LOCATION NOTICES.
THE EDITOR:—In the last issue of your valuable
journal, I noticed a letter under the caption "A Good
T
Suggestion," dealing with a matter which is of the utmost
importance to prospectors. I refer to the question of the
legibility of notices which the locator is obliged to inscribe
upon his posts after staking mineral ground. I think we,
in British Columbia, could well afford to follow the footsteps of the Australians in the particular, at least, of requiring prospectors to nail to their posts plates of tin with
the location notices painted thereon. Perhaps, however,
as by the present practice of writing the notices in pencil,
the wording is legible enough for the first year, the same
purpose would be attained if a second notice, painted on a
tin plate, was put up (say) at the time the first assessment
work is done on the claim. Such a regulation as this would
certainly be appreciated by the bona fide prospector. But
the great trouble, in my opinion, is that the mining laws
are not sufficiently stringently administered; in fact, they
are disregarded with impunity, the sinners relying on the
" good faith " clause for protection. Here is a case in point:
A and B locate a fine quartz lead on a promising piece of
ground. They are apparently too lazy to cut the usual
stakes, and so select a dead tree sixteen feet high for their
No. I post, proceeding to 'square it" five feet from the
ground, and on the smooth surface inscribe the following,
(which may be legal):    The S  Mineral  Claim,  located
by A and B, March 21,1896, No. 1 Post. (I suppose it must
be legal if done in "good faith.") Then the location line
runs out for four hundred feet, but, getting tired, no doubt,
quitting blazing, the locators have evidently strolled ahead
for twenty minutes, and then set up the No. 2 post. It has
the same information written on it as No. 1 post. No discovery post could be found in the direction of the location
line. On looking up the records the claim was recorded
and the following sworn to as being the legal posts:   The
S Mineral Claim, located by A and B, March 21,1896.
The location line runs south 1,500 feet to No. 2 post, and44

■TM
has 750 feet to right and left of location line. The assessment work for 1897 was also recorded, which gives it that
'' good faith" appearance which the Judge always looks
for. It took my partner and myself a whole day to find
out if such a claim as described had been located at all.
The saving regulation regarding " good faith " is responsible for the slip-shod manner in which in too many cases
claims are located, and it would certainly seem advisable
that it should be done away with, so that a prospector
. would know that if he failed to comply with legal requirements, he must expect to " pay. the piper."

A COAST SMELTER..
rpO THE EDITOR:—As a matter of mining interest I
L take pleasure in informing you that the Van Anda
Copper and Gold Company will immediately erect the first
smelter on the coast of British Columbia. The plant occupies four cars, weighs ninety tons, has a capacity of more
than fifty tons per day, and is en route by Great Northern
to Seattle, and by boat from there to Van Anda City, Texada Island, B C, which is in the midst of the Company's
ten properties. These properties are now sufficiently
developed to supply fifty tons per day of $30 ore, which will
give the Company a net profit per ton of at least $20.
Repeated shipments of the pre daring the past two years
to various smelters have proved this value in the ores.
After September 1st the Company will make daily shipments of matte carrying about fifty per cent, copper, three
ounces gold, and fifty ounces silver per ton.

issue, from Messrs. Dier, Davidson and Russell accuses
me of misrepresentation. In answer I may say that at the time
the letter complained of was written by me, the Tinhorn mill
had stopped work for lack of water. All that trouble is over
now, and has been for sometime, as the company has piped
water from a creek one and one-half miles south of Tinhorn
Creek. I may say that the letter of mine which Messrs. Dier,
Davidson and Russell complained of was written last December.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
H. (Vancouver).—There has heen some delay in replying
to your question but the Company is not a prominent one
and information was.difficult to procure. Two eighty feet
tunnels have been driven and thirty feet of open cutting.
The company has funds in the treasury, and from all
accounts means business.
A. McG. (Camp McKinney). It is a matter of regret that
you marked your communication " private." We should
have been delighted to publish so entertaining an effusion.
It is a mistake on general principles to fulminate, and trying to the nervous system. Tbe reference to the Minnehaha was made on the best authority, but if a mistake
occurred you surely might ask for a correction in a less
jffensive manner. We have called the attention of A. W.
More & Co. to the fact that the stock has not been quoted
in their list, and the matter will be remedied.
G. L. (Inverness, Scotland).—We fear that we are unable
to take advantage of your offer.
S. M. (Redhill, Eng.)—No foundation for the rumour.
B. T. (Toronto).—The river will be open for navigation by
at any rate the second week in May.
A. (Brandon).—The stock may recover, but do not hold
too long.    It is not regarded as a very desirable investment.
Mining Engineer (Auckland, New Zealand).—Do not care
to assume the responsibility of advising you in the matter.
There are, however, openings in the country for good men
desiring to establish a practice for themselves in the new
districts.
THE STOCK MARKET.
Stocks have been active during the month of April, and
brokers have found it difficult to fill orders at prices offered.
In Trail Creek stocks, War Eagle has been in great demand,
and the price has advanced from $i to $I.6o, and is likely to go
higher. Deer Park has also been a favorite and the stock is
hard to get at fourteen cents. Very large blocks of Mugwump
have changed hands as some one appears to be endeavouring
to secure control. Monte Christo and Good Hope have been
ready sellers at any price under the regular quotation, and the
Silver Bell stock appears to be commencing to move. A number of sales have been made of Josie, Iron Mask and Virginia.
In the Slocan'and Nelson districts the favorite seller has been
Athabasca, owing to the reported sale of this property to an
English Company, and the stock has advanced from twenty-
six to thirty-five cents.
In sympathy with the Athabasca deal B. C. Gold Field's shares
have been very active in the neighbourhood of six to seven
cents as the B.C. Gold Fields own a large interest in the Athabasca. A number of Dardanelles have changed hands from
ten to eleven cents.
In the Fairview Camp several blocks of Tin Horn have been
sold outside at fifteen cents, and Winchester is quoted at
twenty-one cents.
Cariboo of Camp McKinney has been enquired for at fifty-
two to fifty-five cents with few offering at these prices, but
some asking fifty-nine to sixty cents.
In Coast stocks Van Anda shares are coming into favor owing
to the fact that the Van Anda Company intend erecting a
smelter at once with a capacity for over fifty tons per day.
Van Anda shares are at five to six cents. Channe shares are
also changing hands at twelve cents.
In Lillooet district Golden Cache shares are quoted from
eighty to eighty-five. It is understood this Company is spending large sums of money in new machinery and additional
stamps.

come up to that of March. The principal shipments were
from the Payne, Idaho, Ruth, Last Chance, Rambler and
Montezuma, while the Queen Bess and Black Diamond
(Ainsworth) are now steadily shipping. The Slocan Star
will again ship continuously next month. The following

MACHINERY NOTES.
THE volume of business transacted by the local iron
works of Vancouver and Victoria, has increased enormously of late, as a result, chiefly, of the rush to the Klondike gold fields.    In the B.C.  Iron Works of VancouverTHE MINING RECORD.

the number of employees has been raised to three
hundred, and a sum exceeding two thousand dollars is
daily paid out in wages alone. Seven flat-bottom stern
wheel steamboats, designed for the Yukon River trade,
are now being built by this Company, in addition to which
the S.S. " Cutch," which was formerlyonthe route between
Nanaimo and Vancouver, is being completely refitted and
supplied with new engines. Among other contracts may
be mentioned one from an English company, for an improved suction pump dredger, to be operated on the Fraser
River, and also an extensive dyking plant, ordered by the
Provincial Government for use in reclaiming land in the
Sumas Valley. The Company have been busily engaged
during the past winter in preparing patterns for mining
machinery.
The largest air compressor ever built in Canada, has been
ordered by the War Eagle Mining Company, of Rossland,
from the James Cooper Manufacturing Co. Lt., of Montreal; The machine will have a capacity of fifty drills, and
will be driven by electricity. The fly-wheel is twenty-two
feet in diameter, and weighs in the vicinity of twenty-five
tons. The mine management have also purchased from the
same firm a 300-ton electric hoist, which will lift an average
load of eight tons from a depth of 3,000 feet, at a speed of
1,000 feet per minute. This hoist is the largest in the
world, operated by electricity.
The British Columbia Gold Fields Co., of Toronto, have
recently placed an extensive order with the Jenckes
Machine Co. for a ten-stamp battery, complete, with two
vanners, two ore feeders, grizzly, Blake-Marsden Crusher,
and all the various apparatus making up a complete modern
milling plant. The plant is to be delivered at Nelson. Also,
the Smuggler Gold Mining and Milling Company have
closed a contract with the same firm, for a twenty-stamp
mill, to handle the output of their promising gold mine at
Fairview, and an aerial tramway from the mine to the
mill. The 'mill is expected to be in operation in three
months.
A new device for generating and utilizing acetylene gas
is being introduced in the Province by Messrs. Newling &
Co. of Nelson and Victoria. This machine is constructed
on extremely simple and durable lines, and has, moreover,
the advantage of being cheap. The light is very brilliant,
and the machines recently furnished to the Nelson post-
office, several business houses in the'same town, and to the
No. 1 Mine at Ainsworth, are giving perfect satisfaction.
It is proposed to build a concentrator this summer, to
treat the low grade ores of the Whitewater Mine, of which
there are an enormous quantity.
A ten-horse-power hoist has been installed in the winze
at the 600-foot level of the Le Roi.
In the Ymir Camp there is at present a large demand for
mining machinery. The Dundee Mining Company here
has recently let a contract for supplying material for a
three-line gravity tramway, and tenders are being asked
for the construction of a concentrator. At the local office
of the London & B.C. Goldfields, Lt., plans are now being
prepared for the purchase and installation of a 40-stamp
mill upon the Ymir Mine, owned by the Company. Enough
ore is said to be in sight in the mine to keep the mill in .
operation for several months.
Arrangements are being made to erect a 10-stamp mill on
the Athabasca a promising mine near Nelson, recently
acquired by an English company.
The Colorado Iron Works Co., of Denver, Colorado, received an order from John A. Moore, for one water jacket
smelting furnace, to be erected in the San Juan district.
At a Board meeting of the Golden Cache Mines, Limited,
the tender of the Royal Electric Company of Montreal was
accepted for furnishing the electric plant for the mine. The
contract for supplying the water wheel (23-in. Sampson, La
Felle wheel) and a compressor plant, was awarded to the
William Hamilton Manufacturing Company, of Peterboro,
Ontario. The compressor plant is to be put in at once.
These will involve an expenditure of over $35,000. The
compressor plant will, it is hoped, be working towards the
middle or end of July. Another additional improvement
in hand at the present time, is the erection of a private
telephone from Lillooet to the mines.
TRADE CATALOGUES.
MESSRS. FRASER & CHALMERS, of Chicago and London, have issued a seventh edition of Catalogue No. 6,
descriptive of the Comet Rock Crusher, and a fourth edition
of Catalogue 24, dealing with the Riedler Pumps, Compressors
and Blowing Engines. Both catalogues contain much interesting information.
"The Wilfley Ore Concentrator," published by the Wilfley
Concentrator Co., of 32 Old Jewry, London, E.C; American
agents: The Mines & Smelter Supply Company, Denver,
Colorado. This catalogue contains a well-prepared article
upon ore concentrating. For the Wilfley concentrator, it is.
claimed that it will handle three or four times more material
than any belt concentrator made, that it will save more con- "
centrates; that it requires little or no attention, and that it
will save much expense in power and room.
